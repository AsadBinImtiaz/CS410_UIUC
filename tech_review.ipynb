This is not it...The place is dark,  I felt like I was in a cave...Most Mexican food places have nice, pleasant Mexican music. ..This place had a Spanish rap music which made it very difficult to enjoy our food.

Enchilada Style Burritos and Chimichangas are huge! The weird part is, they are the cheapest entrees on the menu too. They do not charge extra if you substitute for steak, only on the shrimp.\n",

      "My dad always used to tell me that the best Mexican food comes from \"hole in the wall\" places. I wouldn't quite call Maria's a \"hole in the wall\", but it is a very small Mexican restaurant with some of the best authentic food in town. The attached bakers is also extremely good with low prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came here the first time a few years ago after a friend told me that his daughter, who had moved out of Las Vegas, comes here every time she returns to Vegas to visit. I was hooked from the very first meal. I grew up eating Mexican food in Southern California, and though there are a lot of good restaurants in Las Vegas, Maria's stands above most of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know where to start on the food, as we've never had anything bad here. Everyone we have ever taken here or brought with us loves the food here. The surf and turf burrito (carne asada and shrimp) is just phenomenal. The steak is fantastic, the shrimp is seasoned perfectly, the burrito is huge, and it's served wet with a perfect enchilada sauce and melted cheese. I honestly don't think there is anyway for this burrito to get better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combo meals are very good to. Choose from enchiladas, tacos, mini-burritos, chili rellenos, etc... You honestly cant go wrong no matter what you order. They have a combo meal that comes with carne asada, an enchilada, a chimichanga and a chili relleno for $18. It's a massive meal and enough for two people to share, and everything is high quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant is very small, with only about a dozen tables and only one server working. Despite how good this place is, it never seems to be packed, so we always get very good service.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bakery is right next door to the dining area. The Mexican pastries are very good, and they are dirt cheap. I love their pineapple pastries and macaroons in particular, though most of the other items are good to. The only thing I really don't care for is their cookies, which are very large but crumbly and dry. If you like dryer cookies (and some people do, my wife always gets a peanut butter cookie every time we are here) then you will probably love these. Nothing wrong with their flavor, but I'll take moist and chewy cookies over crumbly and dry any day.\n",

I've tried several dishes but one of my favorites is the Chile Verde.  My husband usually gets whatever the special is for that day and it's always delicious.  The Restaurant is open to the Bakery so it's hard to pass up on a dessert.  The service is always personal and friendly.  This Restaurant is located on 6055 E Lake Mead Blvd and I would say give it a try.\n",

I've been kinda into mole for a couple months, and I thought Mama Maria's sauce stood up there with some of the best I've had. Of course it is rich, so if you like something a little fresher tasting, the green sauce was really excellent. We both commented on the quality of the meat - tender, juicy, not blobby. The enchiladas are served 3 to a plate, with sour cream, pico de gallo, rice and beans. I loved the beans - made me think about the runny beans I used to have from my friends' nana's growing up. The rice is blander and not my favorite, but then rice is never my favorite.\n",

The food is good the prices are cheap and the people are friendly. It's a small spot nothing fancy, maybe a little old and worn on the inside, but the food makes up for all of that.

Seriously where else can you get all of that for $20?? And I never like chile rellano's but this one was delicous!! Plus they give you fresh tostadas and salsa that were really yummy too.

I mean with all the veggies, could one live on salsa alone? If yes, this is the stuff you want to choose. The menu options are wide and offer a group plenty of choices. I've never been disappointed in a meal selection here. Plus, there is a bakery connected to it so you can get your concha fix as well.\n",

She told us the food was delicious and the chips were not the usual that you find other places. The chips and salsa was delicious.  The first time we went was on July 31, 2013. We decided to go back on our Anniversary August 7, 2013. We had the Giant Burrito and you can order one and they will give  you two plates, or each order one and take the other half home to have for diner the next night. We also took the chips and salsa for our diner the next evening. It was like eating there but at home. We will definitely be going back there again and highly recommend eating there for those looking for authentic Mexican food. They are located East of Nellis at 6055 E.

      "\n",
      "Known best of all for their Giant Burritos and Nachos, neither particularly rare amongst local Mexican eateries but here said to be bigger and better than most, it was just past 5:00 that two adults and one child entered the combined Restaurant/Carry-Out and Bakery tucked into a small Shopping complex, an invitation to seat ourselves suggested from a woman in back as only two other families were present, a family of four soon to settle the bill and thus leaving only five patrons present for the duration of the visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually electing a rounded booth set against a pony-wall diving restaurant from store, the kitchen window in full view along with a few murals of Mexico as Latin music chimed above, it was with menus in hand that two pages of Food plus one of Drinks was quickly navigated as a plate of sizzling Fajitas was brought to a middle-age Caucasian couple across the way, the server not even making eye contact as she walked, nor as she returned to the register where she proceeded to clean the cash register CPU with a disposable cloth.\n",

      "Eventually offered water by the 'hostess,' a bowl of warm Corn Tortillas and Chunky Salsa without much heat soon to follow, it was with phrasing something along the lines of \"the waitress will be back to take your order\" that this woman disappeared to the back, the 'server' continuing to pay no mind to anything but her task at hand and not once acknowledging the dining room until twenty minute later, when she walked by to check on the other table and was alerted by a rather loud clearing of the throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having twice now debated getting up to leave, or at least to visit the Bakery for some snacks on the way out, it was again with a delay that diners awaited the young woman's return with a pen to jot down an order consisting of two plates and one drink to be shared, the $4 Frozen Margarita with quite a bit of booze admittedly a great deal in a portion that would typically cost guests closer to $15 on The Strip.\n",

      "Not really needing much guidance on such a straightforward menu, the kitchen moving slower than one would guess given the low volume but clearly visible making all but the pre-breaded Tenders from scratch, it was perhaps twenty more minutes before two large plates of food would arrive including the Sample Platter highlighted by tightly rolled Chicken Taquitos plus Nachos, Quesadillas and Chicken Fingers that even the most novice college student could make at home, the Burrito bigger and thicker than a 9-year old's arm a far better choice at just $10.95, the enormous Flour Tortilla stuffed with fragrant Rice, Refried Beans, roast Pork and Pico de Gallo beneath melted shreds of Cheese and a peppery Red Sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impressed by the moist Meat in the Burrito, though others might opt for Carne Asada, Chicken, Roast Peppers or ground Beef, it was with both plates mostly cleared and a sample of thin, spicy 'Mole' tasted that the check was requested not once or twice but three times, the decision at this point made to visit the Bakery next door where a variety of perhaps two-dozen items were offered from an on-site kitchen, the Guava Besos soft and fluffy with sweetness mellowed by Coconut while the Butter Cookies and Turnovers were both fair-to-middling, a far better option available in a Sprinkled Cake wedge that at first looked a little dry but proved to be both soft and not too sugary, the whole to-go Box costing just $3.85.\n",

The tomato sauce in it interestingly had a \"pasta sauce\" flavor, which for me, set it apart from any other Mexican salsa I've ever tried. They sent us home with a bunch too, so I was very happy!\n",

      "\n",
      "We didn't care for the shrimp fajitas or the butter garlic shrimp too much, not very special. The crispy shrimp tacos were a big bust in my opinion because I expected deep fried, breaded shrimp and I thought that was what the menu meant when they said \"crispy\", but apparently that description was only referring to the taco shell, which I cancelled out when I asked to have my tacos wrapped in a flour tortilla instead. Furthermore, nothing had sour cream or crema, which was odd to me. I guess I just didn't realize I had to order it separately.\n",

      "I ate at Mama Maria's on 9-17-2013.  It's located on (6055) East Lake Mead and sets in a little strip mall on the south side of the road.  I would label this restaurant as a Mom & Pop type place. It's small, clean, and the wait staff is very accommodating.  The decor is a little dated with murals on the walls and christmas type lights strung across the ceiling.  I was hungry for refried beans and rice and my waiter Christian, suggested a dish with shredded beef, and my plate had a large portion of refried beans and rice as what I was hungry for.  I was served (immediately with)  salsa and fresh warm (4 flat) tortilla like \"chips\" that were good. The shredded beef was good and not overly seasoned, as was the rest of the meal.  I probably wouldn't drive across town just to eat at Mama Maria's but if I was in the area, I would defiinetly eat there when I was hungry for Mexican Food.  My order came to just under $9 with free refill on my drink order as I had ordered extra beans and rice, I felt the price was reasonable and the food was satisfying.\n",

      "We took the 14 . 7 mile drive from the south end of the strip to this restaurant because of the good yelp reviews, we were a little surprised to find it is actually a small 8-9 table restaurant attached to a Panadaria (bakery ), but it looked nice enough and so we went on in, there were only a couple other patrons, and our waitress quickly cleaned off a table for us and we sat down, she soon returned with chips and salsa. The basket of chips was actually 5 whole deep fried corn tortillas and the salsa was very tasty, medium to spicy with fresh cilantro. Within a short 5-7 minute wait our plates arrived. I had the chicken burrito enchilada style with verde sauce. It was garnished with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. The burro was good sized, the chicken was large pieces of white meat and fairly flavorful, the burro also had refried beans and overall was decent, but kinda dry. My meal was certainly not bad, and the chili verde sauce was homemade and above average. But the entire plate came to the table only warm, not hot like many times is the custom with Mexican food dishes, where the server has to use a hot pad to bring it, within a couple minutes it seemed cold. I inquired about the quality of the other meal and the report was about the same as mine, the food was barely warm, the sauce above average but the  shredded beef was the canned variety and while acceptable certainly not like slow roasted, simmered in spices and cooked to perfection! Overall we rate this place 4  stars. The service was good, our server appeared to be working the dining room alone and was efficient and attentive. The salsa fresh and flavorful. The sauces above average. Probably a very nice neighborhood restaurant, driving here from the strip, we probably passed by quite a few better Mexican food options and probably won't be back, but we will make a stop at Luv-It frozen custard and cleanse our palates with a delicious frozen treat! Adios Maria!\n"

      "My first time here with my girl and I've gotta say, I have not been truly satisfied with a Mexican restaurant since I've been introduced to real authentic Mexican food at my friends places as I was growing up. This place most definitely brought back memories! \n",
      "\n",
      "To start off, anybody who's been here will know how amazing their salsa is. It's not extremely spicy and some people will judge by that but what I look for in a good salsa are the undertones and richness in flavor. IT'S GOOD. Normally when you come to a restaurant like this, you get chips with your salsa. I love that they bring out these warm, flaky, crispy, lightly salted and fried tortillas. Just a tasty little treat before we even ordered. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Horchata tastes great! As I've said, it's hard to please me when it comes to restaurants because people like to take shortcuts and make close to real Horchata. It is a very simple drink but you have to get it right. Here it just has the right amount of sweetness, (making up words now) cinnamony and milky taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already impressed with the pre game they have going on here so I was ready to order. We started off with the Fiesta Plate appetizer and it was awesome. It had quesadillas, nachos, chicken taquitos and chicken strips. Ok so the fried chicken strips are a little out there in authenticity but they tastes good. Everything on this platter was good but I really enjoyed the taquitos! So bomb with the lettuce, beans, sour cream and guac that came with it. My girl and I shared this plate and were already pretty full so it's a good sized plate. I'd say it's great for couples or groups of 3-4. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you really know, burritos are not an authentic Mexican dish. Just throwin that out there! But the way this Enchilada style / wet burrito came out tasted just the way my friends mothers would make them. The plate came garnished with sour cream, guacamole and lettuce. The burrito sat there in a glorious pool of red sauce and melted cheese. Long story short, it was perfecto. Once you undress this little beauty you find this moist rice, beans and well seasoned asada steak. \n",

The only complaint I really have is the chips are not really chips, but tostadas.  The salsa was good, not heavy on the tomatoes and they don't give you a bean dip.  Other than that, I really enjoyed the food.  Really, it prevents you from going heavy on the tostadas and spoiling your appetite.\n",

      "In search of a new good Mexican restaurant, we decided to drive across town after reading the good reviews here on Yelp. I have to say that the neighborhood was a bit suspect, and as we walked up to the door there was a vagrant right next to it. The first thing we noticed when we walked inside was a strange smell, followed by uncomfortable heat. We sat down at a booth, the waitress came over and asked what we wanted to drink, and then we asked her if the air conditioner was on. She proceeded to tell us that it was broken (by the way, the temperature outside was 108). Inside it had to be 100 degrees without exaggeration. She brought back the drinks and the chips and we considered at that point that we might just leave. Even the other guests were mentioning how stifling the heat was.\n",

      "Along with the fact that I've had a bad experience here before with the waitress and the problem of the sewage smell coming through the door upon walking in, I am absolutely appalled by the service that I received today by waitress named Gloria. I received very bad service from her before but because the food here is decent I figured I would give her another chance and thought that she just had a bad day. Upon walking in, I sit down and she takes my order and does not even ask me if I want anything to drink (let alone even offer the option for chips and salsa). She immediately sits down and gets on her phone and starts chatting and laughing and I asked her if I can get some water along with having the free salsa and chips that is normally offered. She told me that they charged for the second round of chips and salsa and the first one is free if you eat in the restaurant. She assumed that I was going to take the food to go which puzzled me as to why she never even asked in the first place whether or not I was going to take the food and immediately took it upon herself to charge me. Already feeling irritated with her service, I asked for her manager and she gave me the name of her manager along with the days that he worked. She also stated her name to me in a very rude way and then turned around to complete what she was doing in the kitchen along with canceling my order.\n",

      "The reason why I come to this place is because the food is good and they're close to my area of residence yet because of that, it still does not give anyone a reason to treat their customers with a lack of service. I've spoken to the manager before and he seems like a very nice guy who would rectify the situation but I'm just hoping that in the future management would be more aware of how  their waitresses treat their customers. \n",

The prices are incredibly reasonable, the food is so so delicious, and the quick and friendly. My favorite are the Enchiladas with chilli verde sauce. For that matter anything with the verde sauce is good. They have good mole sauce too. Only tiny tiny issue for us is that we are night owls and have tried to go close closing time and it seems as if they close a little earlier than 9 sometimes. Having been worked in food service for ages, and given that they are a family run restaurant I totally understand, but just a heads up for anyone else thinking of going towards closing time.\n",

We usually finish the bowl but didn't here. Our food arrived shortly after and it looked great. I asked for no sour cream or cheese and corn tortillas with my chili verde and it arrived with cheese and zero tortillas. The other order of chili verde didn't receive the flour tortillas either. I made due and ate around the cheese- the beans and rice were delicious, as was the chili verde. It had awesome flavor and spice.

Because there was only one server, the later guests had to clean their own tables.  I also used the bathroom after eating, and it was about as clean as a gas station bathroom.

Ordered water but it never came. Girlfriend ordered a chili relleno and it was excellent.  I had the shrimp tacos. The plate was just covered with lettuce and tomatoes but once I got my bearings this too was delicious. Rice and beans were ok but the guacamole was delicious too and a very generous portion I might add. When the check finally came we found we were overcharged. There was a discrepancy in the price presented on the menu and the price that was on our ticket for the plate we ordered. I don't think that is ever happened to me ever at a restaurant before but since it was a small discrepancy we paid and left. If this establishment would step it up on the service and honor prices on their menu it is well worth the trip. One last thing before I go, we looked at the menu online and the menu in the restaurant did not have the same items, little weird.\n",

      "After debating between several items, we decided to order the chile verde, enchiladas verdes, and a chile relleno a la carte. The chile verde ($8.50) consisted of tender pieces of slow cooked pork bathed in a tangy tomatillo sauce, and was served with a side of fluffy rice and refried beans that tasted identical to those we had at a little lobster village in Mexico. The pork was fork tender and I loved the large meaty chunks, but I would have preferred it to have a few more hot chiles. The chile relleno ($5.50 a la carte) was also worth the trip and we even thought it was better than that of Vega's cafe, which previously held our number one spot for this dish. Rather than a white sauce, this was served with a perfectly executed red tomato-based sauce. The batter was thicker and had a good amount of egg, and there wasn't a superfluous amount of cheese in the center. The combination of these two factors pleased me because it resulted in more protein, less fat, and a more interesting flavor combination. It just felt like a more balanced dish than the other chile rellenos I've had. The enchiladas verdes ($8.99) were the least impressive dish, but still better than enchiladas at most other restaurants. I appreciated how the green sauce for these was different than the chile verde sauce used for the pork, because it showed me that each dish is thought of independently. My husband commented on the skill used to prepare the sauces here as they weren't broken (culinary term meaning the fat and acids haven't separated from one another), and I agreed. Even though the food here could be equated with awesome home cooking, the skill level necessary to prepare each of these is probably underrated in the eyes of the consumer. I really wanted the tres leches cake since that is on my top five list of favorite desserts (the best I've had is at Cuba Cuba in Richmond, VA), but sadly they were out so we settled for the flan ($2.50). This turned out not to be sad at all, because despite the weird presentation with plastic covered toothpicks, the flan itself was creamy and the caramelized sugar syrup was toasty and rich. Plus, it was the perfect size. If you don't want to try the desserts here, however, you can go to the shop next door to get homemade ice creams and popsicles, which are also inexpensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I've only been once, it seems like the food here would be fairly consistent since it's run by a couple from Guadalajara who manage the restaurant and do all the cooking, just like at Vega's cafe. Adding to the charm is the old fashioned diner wheel system for reading restaurant tickets, a refreshing sight in a country whose restaurants are filled with P.O.S (point of sale) systems. Plus, it's always great to support a Mom and Pop kind of place!\n",

It's not greasy or oily in the least, the chile is just the right level of caliente, the hominy is tender, and the tripe is clean and not-chewy.  And it's served with dried oregano, lime, chopped onions, chile flakes, and cilantro, so you can garnish at your preference.  A little oregano, a few onions, and some lime juice and my menudo was ready to go.  So, so good!  And probably would have cured any hangover.  \n",

No, no, the chile verde sauce said no, you will enjoy every last tasty morsel here... and it was right. \n",

I was pretty excited bc I love enchiladas and Chile Verde but have never had them combined. Service took FOREVER which was surprising since there was only a handful of people dining in. Food arrives and our plates looked great! I cut into the enchilada and to my surprise, it looked like chicken from a can. I had never seen that before. The sauce was great but it wasn't quite my cup of tea. I figured it would have real chicken versus canned. I wasn't too keen on that so I helped my husband finish his burrito.\n",

You will find many varieties of fried sushi with sugary mayo in these locations if that's your idea of sushi.\n",

      "This is my second time here and both times the waitresses have been rude. Especially the older cock-eyed lady. We've waited for over an hour the first time I went and 40 minutes the second time. When I came in today I saw the tatami styled table was available so I asked one of the waitresses if we could sit at the bigger table/tatami styled table because we had a party of 7. Her response was \"uh no. \" I didn't understand why so I decided to ask another waitress if the table was reserved and she mumbled an answer and walked away. The first time I went, after waiting an hour, one of the waitresses called us up to come and be sat but then she forced us to go and wait longer because another group that was already sat wanted to move to the table we were supposed to be sat at. It ended up being extremely chaotic because the entrance was already packed and the minute we moved to come sit at the table then the line moved up and we were forced to stand in the middle of the restaurant because we couldn't be seated. It seems as though they tend to favor other Japanese people more and try to get them seated as quickly as possible. They need a bigger entrance, a hostess, and better management. They didn't give us enough menus or silverware and didn't ask what we wanted to drink. The floor is extremely sticky, not sure why I guess they don't clean the floors. As for the food, I really did enjoy the food but I may not be back again because of the horrible service and rude waitresses. If you still decide to go, try the tenpura lunch or katsu-jyu. I tried to give them a second chance but I've never felt this disrespected before. Maybe I will try again far far far far far far far far into the future. Not happy at all. Not only that but every one at the table except one person got their food and he had to wait an extra 25 minutes for his. I also had to go grab a napkin and a pair of chopsticks myself because they didn't provide me with one. How disappointing.\n"

Got chided on my 2nd visit for drinking Sake for lunch but explained that my friend had never had tried it.

I had some of the best Tonkatsu ever and my mom is Japanese.  My husband had the Chicken Katsu which was breast and is always a plus.  He said it was so tender and crispy.  I also had the Ika Karaage which was fried crispy yet was not tough at all.  I can't wait to go back and try something else!  \n",

      "Authentic Japanese food in an otherwise nondescript location. Fresh and generously sliced sashimi, lightly breaded tempura done right [not a heavy batter used to disguise miniscule portions of vegetables and cocktail shrimp], flavorful ramen and noodles, and housemade sauces for nearly all their dishes, including the light miso-based salad dressing! We ordered the fried baby crabs and tofu for appetizers [tofu was divine...not overly cooked], then a sashimi platter, a ramen, an udon, a tonkatsu entree and the spicy pork belly w/kimchee dish [an unusual item for a Japanese restaurant as I believe it's a Korean dish, but wonderfully prepared nevertheless]. None of the dishes were too sauce-heavy or overly fried and the soups/broths were not too salty. As a result, you could actually taste the food...what a concept!\n",

It has a tatami room where you can sit to eat and feel even more traditional (usually for big parties). To most, the staff doesn't seem so friendly which I think is a standard Japanese way of just staying out of your way. For me it seems they really like it when I come in and converse in Japanese with them. The cook was even nice enough to make me a special order of curry soba - which was great! I try to come back here every two weeks just to be in that authentic Japanese environment. The only setback is that I live so far from it.\n",

I had to wait at the counter for my sushi set for nearly 30 mins while the guy was chatting a bunch of lame stuff with other customers at the counter. Not only he doesn't seem like a proper sushi cook, his work-attitude was not professional at all. They need to hire somebody else before he pisses off too many customers.\n",

      "We were there around 6PM, the place was empty.  I had second doubt about this place since it was situated in a questionable location. We were greeted by an older lady (assuming she was the owner), not the warmest greeting we had ever received. Few minutes had passed, the server came to take our drink order. We ordered large hot sake & a bottle of Sapporo. The Sapporo came out quickly but the sake came about 10 minutes after. Seemed like he had to heat the sake in a microwave. Fine, I thought got to myself since we were the 1st customer, maybe the sake machine wasn't turn on. We ordered edamame & fried squid legs. They were both just ok, nothing really stood out. For the main course, we ordered Tom Katsu Ramen & a sushi roll. For the ramen, this is legit!  The broth is light & rich (not thick like other place). Only complaint was an overcooked egg. The roll?  Wife ate all of it since it had eel & I didn't really care for.  She wanted to order more so we ordered maguro, ika, hamachi, spider roll, futo maki. Nothing was short of excellence!  Don't mind the way the sushi chef cut the fish, the quality was out of this world. This had to be the best quality we ever had (if you look at my review, we had also tried Nobu's Aspen. You know we are foodies!). We kept ordering like 4 round of sushi total, all of which were the best. Overall, if you rate this place less than 5 stars, you are crazy!\n",

      "I really enjoy Japanese food and had heard how authentic Musashi was. Well, that is true. It is authentic and just as bland as some of the Japanese restaurants in Japan. The ingredients were fresh and my Nabeyaki Udon tasted good and was hot and savory. It just had no spice at all to it. Once I shook in a lot of the spice they brought with it, it became a decent meal. If this was available at pho prices, I would be back. However, with that dish costing $15+, I'd rather pick up some fresh bok choy and some Myojo Udon noodle packets and DIY udon at home.\n",

All the food items sounded delicious. Nothing was too salty or greasy. The stuff we ordered tasted great. I got the miso ramen which was super flavorful. The tempura shrimp was very juicy. It was not like some restaurants where the fried part overpowers the taste of the actual food. Definitely try out this restaurant!\n",

They usually do 3 \"specialty\" lunch boxes: Box A, B and C. A is usually a unique, homemade-esque Japanese dish. Sometimes it is katsu curry. Other times it is ramen. Sometimes it's a little of both and other times it's a bento box. Box B is usually a bento box with a wide variety of sushi dishes and Box C is usually a chirashi bowl. My usually order the A as it is always unique, authentic and delicious. Other recommendations are: katsu-don (katsu with egg and onions over rice), grilled mackerel, chicken katsu and agedashi tofu.\n",

I asked for shrimp sauce or white sauce, they didn't have any. I was kind of disappointed. Luckily my friend ordered some sushi and hers came with wasabi and ginger so I just stole hers. What it all really boils down to is, how good is that eel? Let me tell you, it's one of the most heavenly BBQ grilled things I've put in my mouth! The eel was cut to perfection, huge portions might I add. In fact, it's hard to find places that serve such huge pieces of eel that aren't cut up. Because it was cooked whole, it makes the eel that much more tender. If you've never had eel, you must try it! It almost taste like a flakey fish such as tilapia, grilled with eel sauce, and the rice just soaks up all the deliciousness. \n",

There was a line out the door and only one server so we waited over 20 minutes before even speaking to someone.  We were seated but only received one menu so we shared it.   We were served after four other tables that arrived after us.  We ordered tea and water and our server forgot my tea.  The tea seems powdered.   Husband got Shoyu Ramen, and I wanted chicken katsu curry, but the chicken katsu is $8, apparently it's five additional dollars for the curry sauce.  So i ordered the Tempura instead.   It was very good.  We also got pork shumai, but there was hard bone bits my husband almost cracked his tooth on, and the consistency of the rest of the shumai was complete mush.  The gyoza I recieved with my Tempura was very good.   We ordered an additional side of gyoza and those came with barely any sauce and were burned black on the bottom.  His noodles were very good, firm, stretchy, chewy, delicious.   Very good flavor in the broth.  \n",

      "Musashi's is our go to spot for authentic Japanese. The staff is owned and run by a Japanese family -- huge plus, especially nowadays where you've got all these \"japanese\" restaurants run by Chinese, Korean or the East Asian people. It's always a good sign when you see other Japanese diners dining there. The ambience is simple and unassuming, allowing the food to speak for itself. The food here is AUTHENTIC! The sushi chef is intimidating looking and very serious about what he does. The sushi and sashimi are all very good - chirashi bowl, sashimi a la carte (uni, yellowtail, salmon roe, salmon, tuna). Their rolls taste fantastic too. We always go with the spicy yellowtail, Cali rolls and soft shell crab with avocado. Their cooked items are delicious too: grilled mackerel and fried squid legs apps, any of their ramen and udon bowls or their soba noodles. Pair any of these items with some sake or beer.\n",

He said he hadn't been in years and was curious to see if they were still as awesome as he remembered.  They were.  He got 4 or 5 different types of rolls and all were good, but he said octopus is one of the best tests of sushi.  He said it was a smidgen chewy, but it's octopus.

      "I had high hopes for this place after a friend said it was a well known gem with the Japanese in Charlotte. I enjoy restaurants that are run and frequented by people who know the food well. My friend and I came here on a Thursday night around 8:30pm and were the only souls in the place. Let me also say how hard it was to find this place. Granted, it was raining and dark, but their sign was not lit and was hard to see amoungst the other places in this strip/suite mall. I was anxious to try the ramen noodles since it was a cold, rainy night and it sounded very comfortable, like memories from college days. The bowl was very large but could have used more noodles. I don't eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate. Overall the ramen tasted good, but there could have been much more noodles and less broth. This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly. My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good. We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme. The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland. It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll. The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers! We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent. Overall this place was just ok. I may be back for some take out ramen but honestly I could probably just make my own at home for 95 cents and add some veggies.\n",

This restaurant is family-owned and has been a part of the Charlotte community for at least 10 years. Musashi has and will always be my go-to place for simple, fresh and authentic. No sizzing grill, no fancy chefs or crazy tricks, just the core of Japanese cuisine. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some friends and I decided to go to Musashi for dinner last Saturday. I've been craving their sashimi for weeks! They use the most high quality and best part of the fish so every single bite keeps you wanting more. Salmon is my favorite. Trust me, I kept yearning for a chance to go back. If you're more adventurous, I recommend the beef tongue! If you've never had beef tongue, it is soft yet slightly chewy. The pieces are sliced and the flavors just melt in your mouth! I don't think it's on the menu, but you can always ask the friendly staff. Sadly, they ran out on this occasion. We've also tried the Fukahire Salad (marinated shark fin/jelly fish salad), grilled sardines and a few other appetizers, but the sashimi and beef tongue are my favorites as far as appetizers. What can I say, we're some adventurous eaters!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now.. for the main course! My absolute favorite is the Katsu-jyu, which is fried breaded pork cutlet with egg and onions, served over a bed of rice. A jyu box is actually the Japanese's traditional method of presenting food (how cool!). If you're not much of a pork fan, I would go with the Chicken-katsu. If you're in the mood for some soup or traditional ramen, the Tonkatsu ramen is also delicious! It is cooked in a pork bone base and served with Japanese egg noodle, roasted pork slices, bamboo shoot and green onions. Yummm.. this is definitely not where you want to stroll in and ask for a hibachi grill and shrimp sauce!\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I talk about dessert, I have to say that a meal at Musashi is more of an experience. There are so many varieties that keeps you wanting more. Many Japanese restaurants are Americanized and that special authenticity of the cuisine is lost. I'm glad to say that Musashi still holds its roots close to the traditional culture. Ready for the end of this food adventure? Green tea or red bean ice cream is the only way to end this perfect meal!\n",

Box A usually comes with a rice and meat dish and a ramen soup, although it can vary many days. Both are mouth watering.\n",

But what was quite off-putting was the $2.95 cost PER piece of salmon nigiri. I'd expect it's more like $4.50 to $5 for two pieces. So for $2.95 per piece of nigiri salmon to be rated as good, it's going to have to be pretty good, and unfortunately I'd rank it as even less than average. It's soft, pink, non-fatty and flavor-less flesh was sub-par compared to what I'm used to having. And I'll say that this one experience with this particular order does overall color my opinion. Perhaps there are things that are better choices here.\n",

But, my brother and sister-in-law weren't too impressed. I think Musashi is good, solid Japanese food. Nothing too fancy. What they did they did well. Their agadeshi tofu is the standard against which all other fried tofus are measured. Light, crisp, with a flavorful, but not too salty, sauce. The katsudon is how it should be, hot, eggy, with just the right amount of gravy to flavor the rice. There is also a special Japanese menu, with \"snacks\" which make great accompaniments to beer and sake, or if you're in the mood for \"tapas\". I especially like the grilled cod and the beef tongue. There's also an excellent sukiyaki. The lunchtime bento boxes were also very good.\n",

      "Venue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n",
      "\n",

      "Presentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.  \n",

I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you.\n",

      "- hamachi, sake, hirame, maguro - fairly standard although the salmon was better than expected\n",

They didn't have any special fish such as toro - they said that specials come in during the weekends.   They were out of uni too but sea urchin is not in season apparently.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- hamachi Kama - very fresh, not previously frozen, cooked with some interesting spices \n",
      "- mackerel - grilled and salted to perfection.  Inside secret they get very good mackerel and cook it perfectly so fatty, juicy interior with a crisp skin\n",
      "- sanma - a little bit of a pain to eat, since I don't do the guts, however, some lemon brings to life and a simply flavorful light fish\n",

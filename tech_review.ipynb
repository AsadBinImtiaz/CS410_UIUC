Hot and sour soap always does the trick. I was told that I couldn't order a cup because it was supper time. That's okay, so I ordered a bowl of soup to take home... it was 11.00, and that okay too. My only thing is that it looked like a cup and the soup was not too fresh. It was good though.

What a little gem this place is!  Its a small restaurant in a strip mall, but the food more than compensated for the ambiance.  We tried their General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef and garlic Szechuan green beans.  The spicy chicken was so tender, and had a nice light batter on it.  The beef was even more tender, if that's even possible.  We loved the green beans too, and enjoyed the sauce which was a nice combination of spice and sweet garlic.  We got there before 6pm and the tables filled up pretty quickly after we got there.  They do an amazing job on takeout orders too, as I noticed there was a steady stream of people heading out the door with their bagged up food.  I'll definitely be back, and see some takeout food in my future too!\n",

      "A recent lunch at Nee House changed my whole opinion of this restaurant.  The crab and dried scallop fried rice was as good as the best fried rice I've eaten while living in Hong Kong. The rice kernels were perfectly al dente, not greasy, well-seasoned with the right restraint and the breath of the wok shined through deliciously.  Fried rice and noodles shows the real skill of a chef - it requires good control of heat and timing. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also had the lobster with house special sauce. The lobster was plucked live from the tanks and weighed 2.75 lbs ($15/lb) so totaled approx. $40. The sauce was addictively spicy with sliced jalapenos and ample ground black pepper with the crunch of green onion tops - a little less sugar in the sauce would have made it perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young pea leaves are one of my favorite vegetables and usually available only at restaurants that see a lot of traffic from Chinese customers who appreciate them. They require some plucking to remove the less tender tendrils so tend to cost more. At Nee House, it cost $13.50 per plate. This is on the high side but I cannot resist the flavor and texture of the small tender dark green leaves so have to order it wherever it's served.  I asked for it to be cooked with garlic. It was cooked to the perfect level (nothing is worse than overcooked vegetables), albeit a bit oily.\n",

Sweet, tender and flavorful in a dark sauce surrounded by a bountiful amount of wonderful shrimp. I savored each and every bite. I was so happy the food was hot as it forced me to eat slowly and savor each and every bite. I actually went home and dreamed about this meal, wanting to return the next day and have it again. I litterally ate every last grain of rice off of my plate. Heck I wanted to pick it up and lick it, it was that good. \n",

Crabs were in one, lobsters in another, and healthy looking fish in the third. Seasonal prices are by the pound, not per item. A 2 1/2 pound at $16 and change is going to run just over $40. As lively as they look, I just might splurge!\n",

The ownership has been the same since they took over the location from Yummy China (which was a pretty bad place) and the food has been consistently good.  As others here mentioned, order from the chinese menu, not the western menu.  We've tried pretty much  the entire menu and haven't found too much that we don't like.  The cook sometimes comes out and chats with you - he will make you something specific or special if you ask for it.  They do seafood (lobster, crab, shrimps) really well; their house chow mein (dry style) is HK authentic; their beef chow fun and chicken and salt fish fried rice are some of our favorite dishes.\n",

To top things off all you get is sauce, chicken, bean sprouts and onions. Needless to say, we will not be going back. Unfortunately, we we're regulars at Silver Dragon but they closed down.

      "Bear with me as I leave the actual ordering of food to the real pros in my family, but there is a handful of dishes that are musts.  The Westlake Soup is a great, clean way to start off the meal and makes you feel good about yourself before indulging in the greasy amazingness that follows. As far as meat goes, the HK Style/Peking/Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs are deliciously sauced and have the right amount of meaty bite to go with it.  The Peking Duck is a go-to, as well. Tender pieces of duck with crispy skin served with hoison sauce, green onions, shrimp chips and slightly-sweet, soft buns (ohhh yeah) to wrap it all up in.  I'm a big fan of their Crispy, House-Fried Noodles served with a plethora of meats, seafood and bok choy. They make a pretty good steamed fish (it's served whole, with a head- so don't freak out) if you're being health conscious. It's served in a brothy, soy-saucey, gingery, scallionish sauce and is clean and simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "And lastly, if you are to eat ONE thing here, maybe even one last thing for your entire lifetime, let it be the Kowloon Style Crab..unless you're allergic to shellfish or something. It's a whole crab, served fried and covered in a ton of crispy garlic and jalapenos. The crab shell has a little layer of deep-fried goodness and I can eat the garlic straight up alone or on top of plain rice.  Yep, it's that good, and yep, I'm that disgusting.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're a fan of the basic sweet and sour chicken...fried rice...egg rolls...etc. etc., I'm sure that stuff is good here, but I dare you to venture out of the boring and try some more authentic dishes.  The best way to dine here is to come with a big group and get a lot of different things to try, authentically Family Style!

We ordered the Mongolian Chicken and Black Beans with Squid. The meal arrived shortly after our order.  The Mongolian Chicken was tender, slightly spicy and the flavor was nice.  The Squid dish was slightly rubbery with too many onions.  The flavor was good though.  People continued to pour in for dinner.  This is an authentic Chinese dining with full fish tanks.  Prices are mid range.\n",

Shrimp was rubbery and only lukewarm. Vegetables were overcooked on one plate and undercooked on another. Overall inconsistent and lazy cooking for the price per dish.  It is not worth it. Only decent thing served was Egg drop soup. Also avoid the fish they serve from the aquarium there are live ones swimming but there are also dead ones stewing in the same tank.\n",

The flavor was perfect and the broth was just thick enough. The lunch entrees were just mediocre, BUT the shrimp dish was amazing! We loved it. The jalapeños, onions and chives were a great touch.

      "If you are slightly adventurous like me, order the clay pot with beef stew and turnip.  When I got mine, there was a hair on one of the turnips in the stew (I'm definitely one of the lucky ones...don't be jealous Lana Del Rey!).  No big deal, i get that it happens...so I wait until my waitress checks on us and point out the hair.  The waitress then picks up the pot for a close inspection and acknowledges that it is truly human hair (good thing she did, since my vision at age 34 is deteriorating quickly).  She then holds the pot, looks at me, and asks what I would like her to do (she is young..i'm guessing in her early 20's, speaks English fluently, probably grew up in Phoenix and is part of the restaurant owner's family, at least to my understanding).  Since she is new to this culture of 'eating out at a restaurant', I advise her that my preference is for the kitchen to re-make me the dish.  The waitress gives me a stunned look (since I am asking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow) and tells me that the hair is only on one turnip.  She then puts the clay pot back on the table, and provides me her advice.  She (and Confucius) says that I should simply remove the turnip with the hair from the stew and continue eating the dish.  (Whoop, there is it!).  \n",

Although not meant to be eaten, it was one of the magical ingredients that made the food at Nee House special.

Come for the food only but beware the service is always horrible from the older Chinese waitress with the glasses. This woman does not know or care about the meaning of customer service and being friendly and attentive.  Always very argumentative when asking for something and condescending to us and in my observation with other customers with a sour face. I recently ordered takeout with value of over $120 and asked for extra gravy on a particular dish. This same waitress taking my phone order said it will cost me $2.00 more. They just received a nice order and now she's being cheap and has the gall to ask for $2 which I declined.  No tip for them. They don't value and appreciate loyal customers. We need more good Chinese restaurants in this part of town to give them competition and teach them not to take customers for granted. If this restaurant was in San Francisco the customers wouldn't take this poor attitude and take their business elsewhere.  Unfortunately with popular Chinese restaurants in general they know people come for the food and don't care one iota about being nice and respectful to the customer since they figure there will be customers still coming.\n",

      "I go in at about 2:45pm with my daughter for lunch. There is only one table being used. The woman points to the table right next to the only people eating at the restaurant. So, I smile but went one table over and sat down. The woman comes out of the kitchen and says \"no, can you sit at that table over there?\" I looked at her as if questioning why I couldn't sit at the table I had chosen, and she pointed to one of the large, family-style tables right next to the table I had chosen, and said \"they're going to have dinner\". I moved, but was very perplexed as to what the issue was. Aren't all the tables there for a reason? And who eats dinner at 3 in the afternoon? Anyway, I shook it off and ordered the shrimp and eggplant in Szechuan sauce; it was amazing, as usual. My daughter enjoyed her chicken lo mein. What I didn't love is how the waitress brought out one dish way before the other, and never acknowledged our numerous friendly \"thank you's\". She just had this energy that yelled \"this is the last thing I want to be doing right now. Why are you here?!\"\n",

      "Then....the staff starts coming out of the kitchen to that table that I wasn't allowed to sit near. THAT'S why I couldn't sit there?! I guess I am a second-class citizen that cannot sit at my preferred table if it is too close to the staff as they eat their food. Totally turned me off. Ridiculous. And for those who claim \"it's about the food, not the service\", that is ridiculous too. When you eat out, the way you are treated as well as how delicious the food is contributes to your experience as a whole. Is the food good? Absolutely. Does this mean that it's a good experience?

If you want to substitute an item, learn the art of oral argument. If you need more water or tea, get used to waiting.  If they change a dish from the menu, you'll find out when it is served.  If they decide to clean the fish tank while you're eating,  good luck digesting your good,  Get the picture?  Over the years, we've put up with a lot but today, one of the younger waitresses was particularly rude & insulting even though we've known her for years.

They were $5.99   My husband had General s chicken.  He asked for it because it was not on the menu.  It was very crispy and tasty. I had fried pork chops with salt pepper because I had never had that.  Very interesting presentation.  A little salty for my taste but delicious.  Everything is a la carte.

      "Once seated I saw the tanks of live seafood and saw a sign for sea bass that I was interested in. The waitress told me that they are all out of sea bass and haven't had it for at least three days....This was not a deal breaker for me but my husband got offended by the way she said it like I should have known they were out of sea bass. She said today they have tilapia. I'm not a big fan of tilapia so I ordered off the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the rock cod with vegetables. The Fish was prepared to perfection and was very moist and clean tasting. The sauce was very thin, light and velvety with essence of chicken and was laced with ginger and garlic. This would have been a perfect dish if the bok choy was cleaned properly. I also note the paddle in my rice bowl appeared dirty but when doing a closer inspection I realized the paddle is stained not dirty. This can be easily fixed by using bleach.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband had the Szechwan Pork. He thought it was very above average. The pork was moist. The dish was spicy and wasn't too sweet like the way Americanized Chinese Szechwan is. It wasn't the same as the way The Szechwan Restaurant Mui's used to make it but still this dish was very good.\n",

      "One of the top Chinese restaurants in AZ, they will serve you a Peking Duck at any time with no notice! Excellent lunch menu with a few dozen options to choose from, they specialize in hot and spicy foods but will make anything for you with no heat by request. They serve excellent fish dishes, including lobster and crab which is killed and cooked to order. Other seafood offered includes abalone, sea cucumber, squid, clams, oysters, cod, shrimp, scallops. Average dish runs about $9-$13, a whole Peking Duck is under $30. Love both the Wor Wonton and the Hot & Sour Soup, really the only weak item on the menu is the ribs appetizer which has too much sugary sauce and is pricey for the amount of ribs given. Love their Shredded Pork Schezuan Style, Baked Pork Chop With Salt & Pepper, Braised String Beans and Sizzling Plate Steak With Black Pepper (very unique, well worth trying!). They will make you Shrimp With Lobster Sauce with either brown or white sauce. Can't recommend this place highly enough even if you have to drive an hour to get there!\n",

This place gets packed during peak hours on weekends. I often order take outs during holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas (Yes, they are open!) but order ahead; sometimes it takes one hour.

      "This time I drove nearly 20 minutes to come pick up the food, I picked it up I brought it home and we started eating. Then a fly was discovered in one of the dishes. We called and said we were going to want a refund the lady we spoke to was not going to give us a refund unless we brought the food in. I didn't mind that but she was argumentative over the phone. I packed up the food, and drove all the way back and brought it into the store. I walked in, and I was quiet, she came up to me and said \"let me see\" she took the bag I had and just started walking towards the back. Then she went into the kitchen, I could hear her talking but since I do not speak Chinese I did not know what she was saying. She then came out and the first thing out of her mouth was, \"You ate a lot of the food so I am not going to give you all your money back\". I said, I had no problem with that but I do have a problem with the attitude you are giving me. I said, \"I understand things like this happen but you have not been courteous to us at all\". \n",

The owner added an additional dish about 5 minutes after we began to eat. He became very upset with us when we told them we didn't order it and asked him to take it back. We weren't rude about the mistake with the additional dish, but he quickly got an attitude with us and began to argue with us about the dish and wanted us to take responsibility for it. \n",

      "Coming from San Francisco living now in Phoenix I quickly discovered one of the big trade-offs in my move to the desert from what I regard as the best restaurant town in the country, if not the world - along with NYC of course. After all , there are more ethnic Chinese per capita living in San Francisco than anywhere in the world except Hong Kong. And I enjoy Cantonese as opposed to the other styles like Hunan or Mandarin. \n",
      "\n",

      "My verdict: Pretty good but it's not in the same league as San Francisco: I rate it 7/10. The Wor Wonton Soup was good, though it was lacking the typical veggies and shrimp I come to expect Yes, there were wontons but no veggies of any substance I can recall, and beef, which is typically NOT srved in this soup. But it was tasty. \n",

      "Mt friend and I shared the spicy/salty squid which was actually QUITE good and would recommend. We also had the snow pea leaves as a main veggie dish and while overpriced,  was excellent. We also shared  chicken pan fried noddles which were just \"okay.\" Skimpy on veggies and chicken, taste was a 6/10 though the noodles were fried perfectly. \n",
      "\n",

So many fusion spots, and other imposters posing as the real thing....and Cantonese restaurants seem to be going extinct in Phoenix.\n",

All good signs and nice to see something other than orange chicken, sweet and sour pork and the omnipresent pupu platter and egg rolls.  \n",

Believe me, I'm not a service snob and I usually could care less, especially at a Chinese restaurant where service is never to be expected.  These people are borderline rude and seem to have a vendetta against their customers.  It's really weird.

The mayonnaise sauce had sugar in it.  She said it wouldn't taste like much if I didn't have the mayonnaise sauce.  OK. Then shredded pork  it is.  \n",
      "The lunch comes with soup (egg drop or hot and sour), a spring roll, white rice (or egg fried rice).  Had the egg drop soup which was delicious.  Probably the best I have had in the valley.  Some places put so much corn starch that it is more like a pudding--not here.  The salt level was perfect as well.  None of the noodles usually served with soups here.  Maybe they think it is not authentic. The spring roll was light, flavorful and not greasy.  I didn't care for the egg fried rice as it was too plain.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The shredded pork with hot garlic sauce was a good portion, tasted OK,  but they didn't spice it up the way I asked.  Instead they put a small container of red oil that had hot pepper flakes in it so I could add that to my food to make it spicy.  Really,  you want me to add this oily, greasy stuff to my food?  How is it that other restaurants can spice it up by adding hot peppers without a problem?  The menu indicates that it is a spicy dish but it was not.  I ate most of it but took the rest home because the portion was very decent for $8.50.  \n",

They also had the salt and pepper pork chops with jalapeños, scallions and salt.  OMG.   That is one of my favorite dishes.  But I thought it was much too big for lunch for me.  They took most of it home because the portions were so large.

The live seafood tanks convinced me that we hadn't made a mistake. We were a party of 4 and all had something different, which we shared. The soup was tasty, the orange beef was outstanding, the roast duck deelicious, and the clams in a garlic and ginger sauce was exceptional.

A word to the wise, get the peking duck... a whole huge duck, perfectly prepared, moist with ever so crispy skin and freshly steamed bao buns for $33.00, it's not for the faint of heart or really the appetite challenged! The shrimp with snow peas is delicious, as is the fried rice and well pretty much everything I have ever ordered from this joint (not a huge fan of their kung pao but thats my opinion)\n",

Most recently we did take out, and well that took 30 waiting in the lobby after the time they said the food would be ready to actually get the food. When we have sat down, the service is pretty slow and seems to take quite a while to get our food! The food is great and the portions are a good size, but wow, bring your patience!!

The older woman that had been taking care of us then told him that they were 'out' of fried rice.  Total crap, am I right?  If he ordered it and it was fine then, why isn't it now?  It soon became clear when the dishwasher came out with his own plate full of fried rice to eat at the corner table with the other staff.  I almost couldn't believe it.

      "\n",
      "From the outside you would never guess it's a Chinese restaurant as it doesn't have any Chinese characters on the sign. All too many times, most of the so-called \"Chinese\" restaurants in Phoenix are way too Americanized so I hesitated when I first saw this restaurant. However, I found out about this restaurant from the Phoenix Asian newspapers and decided to give it a shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside, it's definitely not the best looking restaurant around, but it is a decent setting. One thing you'll notice about this restaurant, which is very much like some of the good LA chinese restaurants is that they highlight their signature dishes on the wall via nice full colored images.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was pretty decent and seems like most of the staff there (cook/servers) spoke Cantonese, so at least it makes the restaurant feel more authentic. The service was very fast too, had a nice Hong Kong feel to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The menu has the trademark selection of classic Hong Kong Style menu items, easy to read menu with pictures and both English/Chinese writing. Tons of clay pot items, meats, fish, soup, stir fry items. I ordered the walnut shrimp w/ mayo, beef chow fun, Salted Fish with chicken fried rice. Those are usually my favorite dishes to order at any of the restaurants to test their culinary skills. For people who know a little about Cantonese cooking, the importance of the WOK determines if the food is good or not. Usually if the restaurant has a powerful enough stove with a good quality wok, you can tell the difference in the taste of the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got the items, I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. The food was seasoned just right, not too salty. The Walnut Shrimp was pretty decent size, the sauce was not too thick and not too sweet, just right. You can taste the freshness of the shrimp as it had that nice texture to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beef chow fun was a pretty good dish. Beef could've been a bit more \"fluffy\", but still pretty moist compared other places in Phoenix. It was a pretty generous amount. The seasoning on the noodle and beef was a little light for my taste, but still pretty good as the noodles were not too soft and not too tough.\n",
      "\n",
      "The salted fish rice was a very big plate. The salted fish was cut just small enough and the shreds of chicken was perfect compliment to the dish. This was among my favorite dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back to the WOK thing, you can tell this place had some really good WOK action cause all the food came out real hot, and the texture of the food had all of the fresh \"STIR FRY\" element to it that you can't get from a regular pan. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've been back many times and definitely very satisfied. I'd probably caution any folks reading this review is that it is still not at the level of Hong Kong or LA, etc, but for Phoenix, it outperforms its competition by a long shot.\n",

Well, we didn't have much left in the way of leftovers, and since we were at my mom's, there wasn't much to chose from otherwise in the fridge (she is a minimalist when it comes to food).  My dad had been having a hankering for some fried rice for the past few weeks, which worked out since it seems the only restaurants that are open on Christmas are Chinese!\n",

My dad and my sister left to go pick it up after about 40 minutes.....and they were gone for a really, really long time!  I guess the place was a madhouse, and if you wanted a table you had to wait in a line for a table!  They sat at the bar and waited...and finally after sitting there about 45 minutes they finally got the food (note to self: never try to order Chinese food on Christmas again!).\n",

We had ordered some crab puffs, and they were good, but they had forgotten to give us the dipping sauce, which would have made them that much better.\n",

      "This place has the best Chinese food I've had in Phoenix ~ I've searched for 2 1/2 years and tonight was delighted - at last - dang I was happy (a LOT of bad Chinese food in the Valley - YUCK and that this isn't BAD - means it's good -sad right?) So the food was dynamite times ten.  The décor, those big A___ fish in the tank look healthy enough - fairly clean - in a strip mall - whatever - Domino's is nearly next door if you are in a carry out frenzy.  But at over 50 years young, and a trained Chef - I never expected to be treated like CRAP no not CARP - and well frankly I was. This was the FIRST time I have EVER stiffed (no tip) EVER!!!!!!  Felt bizarre - but in a way it was liberating - I have tipped 20% for the WORST service in the country  (it's just part of who I am working in hospitality since I was about 17 y.o)....I was treated very well early on - told my menu choice is enjoyed by many, told how to 'manage' it as I'd never ordered this beef tenderloin in a lettuce cup.  ALL was appreciated.  Tips on making a side sauce, how to use the lettuce, how to eat the best 'bite' ~ and I LOVE using my hands to eat, create little bites - so I chose a wonderfully compatible entrée.  All was well.  The wine glasses were small and not filled generously but whatever.  'House Chardonnay' was drinkable - but down it fast - it's not a sipping wine to enjoy and savor.  Okay so I told my waitress that I'd like to order carryout near the start of my experience here.  She agreed to leave the menu with me so I could do just that at the end of my meal.  When dinner was over (yes I all but licked my plate clean - not a grain of rice left)... I was ready at last ... decided I would order either some kind of vegetable chop suey - or a vegetable dish - as I had juicy scallops at home and thought an easy meal for Sunday would be seared scallops with Chinese Vegetables (I know on Cinco de Mayo right?).  My waitress wasn't around and I got this other woman - abrupt, curt and totally not like my original waitress who was basically civil/maybe slightly warm even.  I asked her, \"I would like to know if I could order a vegetable dish that is pretty much all stir fried bean sprouts - perhaps some bok choy or spinach tossed in - but primarily bean sprouts in a light sauce\" - I guess that was interpreted as \"idiot woman\".  She says no we have nothing like that.  So I went on - well how about vegetable chop suey - but 'heavy on the bean sprouts'?    She was annoyed...Bok Choy is tough, sprouts are tender you really don't want that she pontificates & ends with 'you want meat or only vegetables'  I said I WANT VEGETABLES - IN A CARRYOUT DISH with a LOT of FREAKING bean sprouts - call it what you want - and how you want - but can you or can you not do this?  She says NO - it's bad very bad - bean sprouts are way too watery to order like that.  I say, \"miss I don't really much mind eating the food that I choose to order - if I like bean sprouts - I like them & know them intimately - and I'd like to order a vegetable dish with a LOT of them - as in MOSTLY bean sprouts - think spaghetti - and you can save all the expensive vegetables for another customer.  She says, \"Okay but I have to charge you 2 dollars more\". By that time I was ready to go back to the kitchen myself and wok my veggies for home use the next day - but as it was my first time here decided against it and just said - FINE - JUST FLIPPING FINE ~ CHARGE ALL YOU WANT.  I have a hard time believing cooking staff can crank out fresh food on a Saturday night - all night - and suddenly get 'stumped and stupid' not able to wok bean sprouts - and for all the \"less\" effort charge me EXTRA.  I told her, \"I am a cook/chef, you have great food here and I'm impressed.  However if I tell you I want something - and you have it - the reason I cannot order it should be because management won't allow it - not because YOU feel I will be disappointed in my choice.  Am I clear to you on that?  I want to cook tomorrow using my chosen carry out dish ~ Hmmm... quick review, *a vegetable dish that has a large percentage/portion of bean sprouts* - at your $2.00 more pricing for being so wild and rebellious I guess.  I was super ticked off - at this woman telling me what I should or should not order because somehow she telepathically knew what would work for me and what wouldn't - ?  So I sit and wait for 'whatever' and am getting angrier and angrier... Say YES or Say NO - but please DO NOT TELL me what I ordered will taste like crap ~ stupid, stupid and again very stupid thing to do.  I so was having fun and wanting to finally find a home in delicious Chinese Cuisine - this was better than at our little mini China Town Cultural Center by the airport by far.  So finally the carryout food came ~ and I wrote a note on my bill, my phone number and STIFFED the waitstaff and felt GOOD about it - The second waitress was BAD & mean-acting & gruff - pukey. I order this all the time - 1st time punished for it\n",

We stopped in today for lunch and had the chicken lo mein and the orange chicken. Both specials came with rice, an spring roll, and a cup of soup. With two sodas lunch was $28.00, including the tip. Over the years we have tried many of the items from sweet and sour to garlic egg plant and I don't recall ever having a bad dish. The service is adequate.

Then I dined there with a Chinese friend who ordered off their Chinese menu, and my opinion of Nee House did a 180 degree turn.  If you're ready to be a little adventurous, you're in for a taste treat!  I love their steamed fish, which is slathered in a delicate, flavorful broth.  The Kowloon Crab is a garlicky treat, but wear old clothes when you dig into this sticky hands-on goodie or your next stop might have to be the dry cleaners.  Other favorites are the Szechuan Green Beans and Garlic Eggplant.\n",

The Hibachi's flame was a little out of control, which was hilarious, but we set the skewers on fire when we tried to char our skewered beef. The fried shrimp, egg rolls, crab Rangoon, and BBQ pork were nothing special, but the paper wrapped chicken (wrapped in foil) was a nice change as well as the most authentic thing on the platter.\n",

The generous serving of honey walnut shrimp was also delicious, with plump, crispy fried shrimp and fresh candied walnuts in a sauce that wasn't too sweet or greasy. The rock cod was our favorite, with a lot of tender, moist pieces of fish mixed in with the tender baby bok choy and fresh carrots. It tastes just like my boyfriend's mom's version.

We ordered the black bean version as our family typically orders the vanilla ginger and scallions so it turned out to be a good change up although I'm not a huge fan of the overwhelming volume of black pepper and onion condiment it's stir fried with (fortunately that's not included in the $/pound calculation.

Lobster was succulent and cooked to a good tender texture as some places over cook it to a rubbery disaster. I thought the seasoning could've been more heavier on the black bean as the garlic  overpowered the dish as well as the abundance of bell peppers.\n",

I am still puzzled why so many people rave about the walnut shrimp. It is covered in a mayonnaise sauce that takes away any crispiness that should have been there. The garlic chicken was pretty decent, but the sweet and sour fish my dad ordered was sub par. The sauce was good but it seemed to be missing the fish. It was more like fried breading. They also feature Kirin and Kirin Light  beer on the menu, but don't ask for it. They don't actually have it in house. This place is not worth a repeat visit.\n",

The Shanghai Noodles, my friend's favorite, were very dry with no sauce, and definitely no spices added.The Kung Pow Chicken and Mandarin Beef literally had no taste and not even soy sauce or salt and pepper would bring them up to par. We all enjoy spicy food and we found only two chiles between the two dishes, that were definitely not hot the way we like or have had at other Chinese restaurants. The only dish that resembled what we expected were the Walnut Prawns. This place is more expensive than any other Chinese takeout we have used over the years, and not worth the extra money--so you don't always get what you pay for. Our bill at Nee House was $54 [and we even tipped $6 bucks] compared to a recent similar order from Bamboo China, which was $34 and excellent! Last time we will order from here.\n",

Moved here 6 mos ago from the SF Bay Area and was really disappointed in the lack of tasty food (don;t get me wrong - I love my new desert home), but it takes a while to find new favorites.  I've found one in Nee House.  The only thing I haven't liked here is due to a personal preference - not the food itself (I loathe green onions or rather - it's a mutual loathing!!!  cuz these things just don't want to die!!!).  The service is good and can accomodate large parties well if you call ahead.  I was surprised to read other posts about lack of friendliness and service as that has never been my experience - even before I was a regular.  Hey, we all have bad days - or aren't as \"chipper\" as others think we should be sometimes, right?  Anyway - I am SO glad to have found Nee House.  It's a keeper. Enjoy!\n",

At this point I was very upset due to the fact that she just dropped off our meals and didn't come back to check on us. When she came back it was because she finally heard us calling after her and I told her my order was wrong and I did not want a new one, I just wanted it off the bill. She didn't say anything and left but came back with a younger fat boy and had him tell me that there's no onions in my food WHEN THERE CLEARLY WAS. He also had the nerve to be more careful when ordering when I thought what I had order was pretty specific. I was so upset that instead of offering me a different plate or something they came to tell me that I was wrong not them. I told him to stoping being rude and that I'm not paying for the wrong meal.

It is December and it was raining. He did nothing.  I asked the waitress, she said \"nothing I can do\".. my sister then asked Jade who owns it, and RUDE doesn't even begin to tell you. She couldn't have cared less.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK.  Tasteless food, rude personnel and dining in a walk in Freezer is the worst experience all the way around.  AND I used the ladies room,,, FILTHY.  You could see where they had sloped some water on the floor in the center but the from 6 \" away from the wall to the wall, FILTH.  NO thanks, how they keep their license beats me, how they keep anyone coming back is even a bigger mystery, it sure isn't the service or the food, must be the only place to get Chinese in the neighborhood.

      "Okay, other Yelpers are not overly impressed with this place, but I'm ecstatic.  Major bonus because we've actually got an \"authentic\" Chinese restaurant in North Phoenix.  The tanks are filled with fresh crustaceans soon to be cooked and devoured.  Caucasians are not a majority when you assess the customer base, and the decor can be called \"clean but dive-ish\".  I love it.  The table cloths used at dinner time seem unnecessary given the rest of the decor.  The portions are plentiful.  The food has lots of flavor.  The chicken with black bean sauce is fantastic and spicy.  The prawns with honey pecans was okay, but a bit too rich.  The prawns are covered with an unusually rich mayonnaise sauce, which although wasn't my favorite, I give them credit for serving something unique.  The chow fun noodles should not be missed.  This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant.  North Phoenix is blessed to have Nee House in the neighborhood.\n",

      "I was really disappointed with my most recent visit to Vintage 95. I make it out there every six months or so and always talk it up to friends. Tonight I went with my husband and in-laws. We ordered a carafe of sangria, which as always was top notch. My in-laws ordered bruschetta - they ended up with a ton of untoasted bread with a very thin coat of ricotta and a light topping of good quality tomatoes. Tasty but not bruschetta and definitely not worth $14. My husband and I got the \"artisan board\" with one meat and one cheese. For $13, we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese, four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata, stale bread, 2 crackers, raw unsalted almonds, six grapes, and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons! The food was a huge rip-off, and not at all the quality or quantity we have gotten in the past. The saving grace of the night was the sangria, which I still think is one of the best in the area. But overall, I don't think this place is worth a trip out anymore.\n",

      "Table was ready for 4 and a baby. I've been here for dinner and drinks but never been here for Sunday brunch so decided to give it a try. Actually the original intention was to find chocolate banana pancakes from the day before but noticed it was only a brunch for Sunday- not Saturday. Looking at the menu the first item that caught my eye was the chilaquiles for $10. I've had it at a different restaurant and had to try it for comparison purposes. It was quite unique in that the tortillas was cut up strips and fried. Some were covered in Oaxaca cheese and cotija  cheese and red pepper coulis with some shredded green chili pulled pork hidden here and there and a sunny side up egg on top and some sauce. Not too bad. It could have had a little more sauce for the extra fried tortillas and a little bit more pulled pork. Others ordered the Bear Republic (chicken breast sandwich with avocado, lettuce, tomato, and bacon with a side of dill mustard like potato salad) for $12.50, and the Picadinho (diced NY strip steak, peas, rum sauce, Brazilian rice, 2 eggs made how you like and a side of seasonal fruit) for $16. A list of cocktails are also available like sangria and mimosa. Cool place for brunch.\n",

The happy hour food choices were VERY small and overpriced. We had the margarita  flatbread, which was basically 4 crackers with some cheese and a tomato slice. Also the walnut bread with brie. That was a bit better, but still a very small portion. Each were $5. We split a bottle of wine, which was $20. Not too bad of a deal. However, it was a sauv blanc, and it was NOT cold. I asked about it, and they brought an ice bucket to put it in. Overall, I don't think I would return. Too many other options.....\n",

With that said, the GF liked it. We ordered the bruschetta which was totally different. You actually pick 4 flavors out of 6 flavors - mix and match how you like. The flavors were not what I was expecting. We got the  Pistachio, Date and Marscarpone; House Made Ricotta, Heirloom Tomatoes and Basil Vinaigrette; Tenderbelly Bacon Jam and Whipped Goat Cheese; and the Prosciutto, House Made Ricotta and Fig Honey. The prosciutto was by far the most \"normal\" of the bunch in my opinion. The tenderbelly bacon jam one was interesting - like a smoky, meat, jelly concoction that really didn't make sense to my tastebuds but was still good. The pistachio one felt like I was eating a gooey trailmix blend on a piece of bread. Again, not bad but just not my style. Maybe someone who likes the finer things in life would enjoy them more than I did. Your mileage may vary and I think I would have enjoyed the bowl of olives more.\n",

I can't knock a place for doing what they do any more than I can knock McDonalds for not being a 5-star restaurant. For what it aims to be I think it does a very good job at.

      "Had such great hopes for this establishment. We have been here four times pervious and it was great the food and serving portions were wonderful. Unfortunately on our return tonight they have redesigned their menu and portion sizes. We questioned the waitress on the serving sizes and she recommended that we bring it up with the Manager since she had, had the same response from several people recently. We have pictures of our food from the previous visits, because we are foodies and like to share pictures of the happy finds we are enjoying. The Manager tried in many ways to tell us it was the same size serving, even though the picture was way more bountiful on all of the previous visits. We finally gave up on trying to discuss it with him and went about our dining experience. Nothing was the same even the combinations on the bruchetta board was different. You can definitely tell that they have scaled everything back to save on cost and possibly even changed food distributors. We are very sad because we probably won't go back and we had been so excited to have a place like this so close to home. We hope they change and if they do please let us know.\n",

      "I came here with my husband recently for my birthday. Chose this place based on Yelp reviews since we live an hour away and weren't familiar with the area. We decided to come at 5pm, in the middle of what I read was their happy hour. It was a Sunday and it certainly wasn't crowded. There were maybe 2 other tables when we were seated. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's a nice place. A little smaller than I expected from pictures on Yelp, but that's not a bad thing. My husband and I both got drinks. He got a beer and I got \"Ginger is a Peach\", which was good. \n",
      "\n",
      "We decided on the bruschetta board. Of the four we tried, our favorites were the tomato and the salmon. Our least favorite was the fig/pistachio one. It just tasted too much like a dessert. It was the only one neither of us volunteered to finish. \n",
      "\n",
      "My husband ordered the New York steak and I ordered the duck. We both really enjoyed our entrees. I guess word that it was my birthday got out, because out came a dessert...it was like a s'more in fudge form. I expected it to be warm, but the fudgey part was actually cool. Not sure if it was supposed to be or not. I'd seen pictures of other desserts on Yelp even though there was no dessert menu that I saw and I would have likes to try something else, but the s'more thing was pretty good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was a good experience. Our server seemed a little over expectant...always looking at us like we were being too slow even though that wasn't the case, while at the same time stopping to chat with another table like old buddies. But it didn't bother us much. The prices are a bit high, I feel, but the food is good.\n",

We ended up splitting an app and entrée and they split up the food for us which was nice. We ordered a burger medium well but it came out rare which was disappointing. The burger itself looked better than it tasted but the fries were good.  I could take or leave this place though, hence three stars.\n",

      "I have been to Vintage 95 probably 8-10 times now & normally it could be a 4 star place.  It's typically great for what it is, a local restaurant in the AZ suburbs, that don't always offer non-chain restaurant options.  We went to restaurant week last night & didn't care for it.  The restaurant was almost empty, but the service was super slow.  We were asked to take our silverware off the plates being cleared to use them again; which is fine, but also a weird request of the customers in any typical medium-high-end restaurant.  We were sitting outside & a kitten/it's \"patio cat\" mom were climbing all over the tables.  I mentioned that sadly, I'm super allergic to cats so I didn't want my silverware on the table that we assume previously had cats walking on it.  We all balanced the used silverware on top of our water glasses.  Which throughout the evening someone was always sitting with an empty water glass for 5-10 minutes.  The menu was average & too large of portions for restaurant week, my mid rare steak came out wrong twice; first blue rare, then rare, but at least I could take it home & finish cooking it there correctly.  The cocktails were good, it was a lovely evening weather wise, and the staff was kind.  We will be back, I just don't suggest it for restaurant week or if you have kitty allergies.  Side note, the kitten was precious & we were told it needs a home.\n",

Our party showed up 20 minutes early thinking we could get a drink at the bar or maybe, just maybe they would have our table ready. Our table was not ready so they sat us outside so we could enjoy a drink while we waited for our table. However, a storm was brewing outside and it started to rain. So they moved us to the front patio (this would have been a comfortable place if they had a misting system), it was a humid 111 degree day, so we were hit, thirsty and hungry by this point. Our server John came in to turn this unfortunate situation around, he got us drinks with assurance and a smile. We didn't sit at our table until 8:30 or so, but they provided customer service by giving us complimentary champagne. We were taken care of and satisfied.\n",

There is a sincere dearth of eclectic and inventive restaurants in the east valley in my humble (albeit) transplanted to AZ opinion and I've admired the menu here for a while.  So happy I had a chance to enjoy it for lunch and was not at all let down.  Bruschetta was fresh, creamy, with wonderful variations on top perfect bread. My lovely friend got the special salmon pasta and I had the Havana (having just seen Chef, in the mood for a Cubano), and everything was simply perfect.  Our waitress was great, manager checked in on us and as my friend and I had not seen each other for a while, sat for a 4 hour lunch and was never made to feel like we need to \"move it along.\"  Even got iced teas to go (a personal favorite touch for me).  Now, onto the décor and ambience, a mixture of tables and comfy chairs and couches for wonderful conversation areas.  Don't be mislead by the \"wine bar\"...which is most definitely it is..because it is a full menu restaurant.  I will most definitely come back for dinner and many more lunches.  Downtown Chandler is a nice little gem.\n",

But even then the execution wasn't great. The turkey panini was flat grilled on dry bread so it crumbled as you picked it up.

I read such bad reviews about the food in the Phoenix area from foodies like myself who come from places famous for their independent food scene. Once again... HAPPY! Granted the meal I ordered was simple. Had the new york strip with green beans.But it was perfect! I ordered medium rare and it was truly medium rare. The steak was quality, the beans were cooked perfectly and spiced beautifully. The one negative was weird.. the plate was tiny. So small that I had to take half my steak off the plate and put it on a side plate to be able to cut it. The sauce was falling over the side and the tiny, avante garde plate had a bizarre swoop in it so i couldn't rest my knife on it without it sliding off. That should really be changed. But back to the good stuff. The bartenders were fabulous! Both recommended wines were perfect, they were friendly and funny and best of all... quick. This is going to become a regular haunt for sure.\n",

      "\n",
      "I enjoy Vintage 95 on a regular basis but only for happy hour for a few drinks and some apps. There are good deals for wine and flatbreads. The atmosphere on the patio is quite lovely. Service is pretty good but it depends on your server. A few of the servers are pros, really know their stuff, and want to make your experience positive. Others are not as attentive and friendly. So it really depends. In my opinion, the ambiance, the cool firepit, live music, and good specials are worth it if you are planning to head over for some drinks after work. You will really enjoy yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Planning an event for a large group is a completely different story and I highly discourage anyone from considering this. I worked with a one of the Vintage 95 managers to plan an event for about 14-15 people for several weeks. At first, I was very happy with their willingness to work with my budget, menu preferences, etc. As we got closer to the event, however, the responsiveness dropped but upon a few friendly nudges, eventually we got the menu, date, prices set. When I showed up with my large group, the event fell apart. The server didn't realize we had a prix-fixe menu, wasn't aware of any of the requests I had made in regards to drinks/ bottles of wine. It was as if I hadn't even made any preparations in advance. He seemed embarrassed and did whatever he could to make repairs. I was embarrassed to be hosting such a poorly run event but we all tried to stay light-hearted. First round of drinks and appetizers was pleasant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then we waited over an hour for the main entrees to come, because, surprise, the chefs were probably unprepared. Food was mediocre at best and the efforts I had taken to have a light, family-style tapas type of meal (which the manager had actually suggested to me, not vice versa), was completely ignored. Dinner was awkward. Food was not great. I was disappointed to say the least. I think all would have been made better if the manager would have come out, apologized for the inconvenience or misunderstanding and perhaps offered some desserts or an appetizer... something, anything to show they recognized they did not meet expectations. Aside from our server being great and doing his absolute best, the rest of the management staff didn't make much attempt to have us leave on a good note. Having worked in the food industry myself for many many years, this is just not cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is worse, I emailed the original manager, who I worked with to plan. Not a mean, what in the world happened, type of email.. just a casual note praising the service but pointing out the obvious misses. I didn't receive so much as an  acknowledgement. Again, not cool. \n",
      "\n",
      "So here I am, compelled to give you the good and the bad. I think this place has excellent potential and has an awesome vibe for chilling. If you're looking for something more serious and prepared however, not the best place. \n",

They had a couple wines that are pretty rare and hard to find and compared to other restaurants, the mark up wasn't too bad. The sommelier was a little young in his skills but he knew enough to pair a couple basic dishes with the typical accompanying varietal.  The food was good. We had charcuterie and a couple salads. The Pear is delish! I would have liked to see more options on the dinner menu, especially with the extensive wine list. But the dishes we did have went well.\n",

      "Never again will I allow this place to ruin my dining experience. There are so many more places to spend my dining dollars. This year, for Valentines Day (actually on Sat the 13th), I made reservations (in January) for dinner with my wife and when we arrive, they want to seat us at a \"table\" that is actually a trunk that sits lower that the actual seats that surround it, one of which is sofa type seat. When I ask for an actual table I am told that the only \"available\" seat would be outside. Mind you, I specifically requested an indoor table when I made my reservations. It was just about 6 PM, and although the rear patio was pretty full, inside the restaurant there were literally 10 to 12 empty tables, including two right next to the \"table\" we were directed to. When I pointed that out, one of their condescending staff members proceeded to remind me that it was Valentines Day, like I was some kind of moron who didnt realize that. They also told me that if I wanted a \"real table\" then I would just have to wait...wait for what? One of those empty tables to be available?  \n",
      "Basically I felt as though we were only good enough to be seated at a trunk, but not an actual table. Apparently they save those for someone who's reservation is more important. That silly trunk table was suitable for sitting down to have some drinks and maybe a few appetizers, not for a couple trying to enjoy a Valentines Day dinner.  Who wants to try to eat dinner off a trunk no higher that the seat you are sitting in (maybe 20 inches high....) and no way to even put your feet under it? \n",
      "Anyhow, this was my last visit to Vintage 95. This place needs stop trying to be the hippest spot in Chandler and start caring about their customers dining experience. From a previous visit ( I walked out this time) I can tell you that the food is actually pretty good, but they make is so difficult to enjoy it. Like I said above, Never Again.\n",

      "My wife and I celebrated our 3rd anniversary at this fantastic place years ago.   We decided to come back for a great valentines dinner.  When we asked the server about the dishes we remembered so fondly, he said we have had several chefs since then and they change things to their tastes so we don't have those any more.  We should have just left.  I had the salmon and coconut rice.   The fish was nicely cooked and charred but had no flavor and the rice was underdone.  My wife had the beet salad but we found no beets, no feta, and she said it didn't taste good.  I guess the current chef is a fan of my 8th grade cafeteria cook and loves bland microwaved food out of a bulk box.   The highlight of our meal was the cute feral black cat that kept visiting our table on the patio.   Even he wouldn't eat the salmon.....what does that tell you?   The server rocked and the patio was really nice.   They comped our meal but the mgr didn't even bother to come out to speak to us or anyone the entire time we were there.  I think the numerous chefs may not be the issue as much as the mgmt.  such a shame that this place has devolved into what it is now.   Do not waste your time as this is not even a shadow of what it once was.   So disappointing.\n",

They sat us at the most awkward table in the whole place  which is this 2 person table located right by the front waiting area and way too close to another table where you have to worry about bumping into the person behind you so we asked to move. I ordered the Ahi Tuna and it tasted terrible to me..the tuna itself was good but everything else did not compliment it at all..I felt like it was just some random things added when you experiment with food but didn't come out as good as you thought it would. I just ate the tuna. I also had the banana tres leches and since I am Mexican I'm going to be terribly picky about this. They definitely had the right idea but the banana flavor tasted generic when it would've been better if it tasted more like real bananas. Other than the food this place had really good service and a nice atmosphere but if it wasn't for those two things Vintage 95 would have got 2 stars for overpriced not so great tasting food.\n",

While the wine list wasn't extensive, the varietals were wonderfully chosen.  Hubby went for the Malbec and I, a Rosé.  The bruschetta seemed like a good pairing for our wines.  It was disappointing when it finally came out.  I could honestly have made this, or better, at home.  Costco goat cheese atop what seems to be pancetta, but tasted like liverwurst, was my least favorite.

Ok I will say it, it was NASTY, lacked flavor \", was cold, and did I say lacked flavor?! I could be the only one star review because I'm not a lush who drinks my lunch or dinner, but this is not a place to come for any food or appetizer...

      "We then moved to a table and had the scallop appetizer.  Great presentation and excellent preparation.  Followed that w/ the Ahi with Kimchee, on rice cake with a hot pepper sauce!  Outstanding prep for the ahi, seared just so lightly.  The Kimchee had a dry heat type of seasoning which was unusual and excellent.  The hot pepper sauce went great with the Ahi.  Wife had the Bruschetta mix, which was equally good. \n",

Outstanding decor invites you to your dinning table or casual dinning at one of their couches or fire-pits. The three of us sat at a table next to the wine room and we started off with a flatbread which was a great way to start off our meal. They have an extensive wine list and we all had a glass of what our personal preferences was that night. Axel was our server and not only was he attentive to our needs but he was extremely personable. We all dabbed in each others entrees and had nothing bad to say about any of them. Personal favorite was the burger, cooked to perfection! We closed the place down as we talked to the Sommelier and GM. Thanks to everyone at Vintage 95- we will be back again next year!\n",

For the cost of the fries, we thought there was an ample amount, they were garlic-y but not too garlic-y, and the dijonaise that came with them was an absolutely perfect dipping sauce. I'd definitely get them again. We felt similarly about the brie & toast, it was a perfect sized amount to go with some drinks.\n",

      "My wife and I have been to Vintage 95 twice in the past for dinner and had a decent experience (3 stars). But this last time we went, it was not very good. The food was decent, we ordered the meat and cheese boards and a couple of drinks. For the most part the quality of food meet our expectations. I am only giving Vintage 95 2 stars due to its service. When you eat at a restaurant with this price point and atmosphere you have certain expectations which were not met. Our waiter from what we could tell was either new or inexperienced. He did not have a good understanding of the menu and took 15 min to visit the table after we were seated. He was also setting up for a table of 6 that had reservations next to us. At the end of our dinner we could see that he was waiting on most of the tables in the restaurant. We counted a total of about 8 waiting staff including the bartenders and a manager. We could see out server was overloaded with tables, so we didn't give him a hard time or say anything. Unfortunately the table of 6 that had been seated next to us didn't feel the same. They told the server they were unhappy with the service and \"didn't want to be forgotten\". What really stands out in all of this this is the manager, who spent his whole evening talking to the staff. The staff was well dressed, mostly in black wearing ties, but the manager had his shirt unbuttoned (chest hair) and looked like he came off a night on the town. We did not see him address any of the tables, welcome guests and making sure their needs were met. This is where Vintage 95 failed, you have a waiter that is struggling and a manager that is more concerned with socializing then helping. We will not be going back to this establishment, there are too many other better options in downtown chandler.\n",

The bacon one was just horrid but others have liked it so maybe its just me : )The tomato bisque was AWESOME! Prime rib - not bad but not fantastic either, definitely overpriced. The very best part of the entire experience was our server, Richard. He was seriously amazing. He is the only reason they are getting 4 stars, should be a weak 3... I can make just OK food at home for less than $150. I will definitely try it again because I really loved the place and  want to make this work!\n",

      "A few stops in here so far and we're well on our way to becoming regulars. Vintage 95 in the Old Town Chandler area, replaces what was an embarrassingly bad short lived asian restaurant. The location is gorgeous, great back patio, a small front one too if you want to do some people watching, or just want to watch the turnover of restaurants in the strip, which happens so often that yes, you may actually be able to see them close and open within the span of your meal / bottle of wine. The service has always been friendly here, and though we usually come during \"off\" hours, it always seems fairly quiet for lunch. The food menu is not incredibly diverse and sort of falls into wine bar modus operendi, i.e. assorted bruschetta, sandwiches, etc, but for the most part is well appointed and tasty. One star taken away because the food hasn't always been mind blowing. So pick and choose carefully, and you should be fine...lets just say that if the item isn't normally in your wheelhouse, don't order it. If its the kind of thing you'd usually be ordering anyways, the familiarity will get you by. (The Green Chile Pulled Pork is quite tasty...but those words in that combination is going to get me every time) The wine list is great, the specialty cocktails are fun, the ambiance is a succesful combination of warmth and cool, and the service staff always pretty like-able. The business is still pretty young, but Chandler, we really need to be helping the good ones out. This is a good one, they've got a good thing going here. so lets keep them around.\n",

      "We were both really excited to try this place, and were thrilled when we saw that there was a groupon available.  We went on a Friday night- it was easy to make reservations that morning, and they called to confirm later in the day. \n",
      "The couch/chair seating we were given was a little weird, would have been great if we were just doing wine, but the table was small and we had to hunch over to eat dinner. \n",
      "The live music was great, not too loud at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "We both started with a tomato bisque with grilled cheese croutons. ( The salads they offered were weird and had way too much crap on them.)  The bisque was really rich and cheesy, neither of us could finish it- but it was good. There were 3 grilled cheese croutons in the soup- but they were super soggy mushy blobs since they were put in rather than on the side. \n",
      "\n",
      "It only went downhill from there. We ordered the veggie flatbread for our starter.  It tasted like a cheap supreme pizza. It had red peppers, artichokes and mushrooms on it. It was an extremely thin bread/crust. Cracker thin, but soggy so it was hard to eat the pieces fell apart when you would pick them up and all the toppings fell off. It was also burnt, and the sauce they put on it tasted like they warmed up a can of tomato paste on the stove with sugar and oregano. It was awful. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the entrees I had the salmon- The server said it would be served medium- It was extremely burned- the edges and bottom were black and gross. There were only a few edible bites in the center- but they had to by picked at as to not get the charred bottom in the bite. The salmon had a mild flavor, but no detectable seasonings.  It was served on coconut rice- it was not good. The rice was kind of sweet and mushy, I like the almonds in it for texture- but only had 3 bites- one on its own, one with the salmon, and one with the salmon and mushroom salsa. \n",
      "The Mushroom salsa was no edible- it was pungent, very sour and vinegary. \n",
      "\n",
      "My Boyfriend had the Vintage burger- it was a short rib and chuck (? I think) Burger. He usually has a huge appetite- but he did not like it at all, he said it was burned and very dry and he had to choke it down. It was served with mixed fries ( half regular and half sweet potato) He ate some of them but was not a huge fan. ( He left 3/4 of the fries and 1/3 of the burger.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Another server came to take our plate- mine was taken really early on and there was very very little eaten from it- she asked if I was finished as she was taking the plate- and walked off with it after I said yes, but before I could say anything else or ask for a replacement-  \n",
      "\n",
      "They had paired the entrees with wine- Salmon came with a Pinot noir, and the burger came with a nebbiolo. Both tasted watered down and thin-but were drinkable. The Pinot was really really sweet- and he Nebbiolo had a really rich nose- but was very flat on the tongue.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The server we had was really friendly, but seemed like he was busy. We didn't like that it seemed like they were all in a rush- and was more of a team effort for getting us our food/drinks/bussing the table.\n",

      "Wednesday night. The set up was really cute. Had live music that wasn't too bad. My friend and I sat outside in the back. We ordered drinks which took a little bit of time to come even though there were 5 tables totaling 17 people for both inside and outside. and yes I counted!! We ordered dinner 40 min passed not one waiter checked to see if we would like more drinks or anything. I flagged down our waiter and he said \"Oh let me check\". he apologized and returned to see if we wanted more drinks, we ordered drinks. The food came another 15 min. later but not the drinks. I ordered the tofu dinner which my noodles were extremely hard and the tofu was ice cold. The lamb wasn't well done but burnt. I explain this to our waiter and he apologizes saying he spoke with a manager and they would comp us for the dinner. My guest and I went to speak to the manager. I told him I would pass on the comp but dinner was really bad it like they just threw some food together without taking serving temperature to consideration. We all know that could result in food poisoning, illness or death. I understand every place of business, person and or establishment is entitled to an off night. However I would not recommend this place anyone due to the service alone.\n",

      "We came here wanting to try out a restaurant in downtown Chandler. When we got to the front desk, hostesses asked us if we had made a reservation. Since it was a spur at the moment thing, we did not have one. They told us that even though there were tables that were opened inside the restaurant when we arrived, they were all booked up and offered us to sit in the patio area. We were  getting ready to turn around and they offered us a couch with a huge tables that were shared with two other parties. The waiter was very attentive and certainly knows his menu very well. He offered us many great suggestions and we did end up ordering what he suggested. I ordered a duck and my friend ordered a plate with different variety of meats, cheese and bruschetta. The duck is very tender and juicy. The portion is perfect for one person. I also love the dishes that my friend ordered since I enjoy small bite dishes. \n",

Due to the good drinking experience I've had there, I decided to take all of my friends to Vintage for dinner on Christmas Eve. There were 11 of us that evening. It was awful.. So awful that my friends said that I'm no longer allowed to choose where we go for dinner! The server was extremely slow.. which may have played a part as to why our steaks were completely cold. I could have dealt with a just warm steak, but cold? Not a chance! The food didn't even look good.. The plate presentation was as if the food was just thrown together and out it went. So bummed. I was hoping that this would be our new go-to for a great dining experience. Luckily I had plenty of appetizers waiting at the house after wards, because everyone was hungry.\n",

The only suggestion I have is that their live music is turned up louder so you can actually hear it.   The live music was the primary reason why we wanted to sit inside as it creates a nice atmosphere but the restaurant is already a bit loud and they had the musicians mic down to the point where it only felt like it was background instead of feeling like it was a focal point to enjoy.   I did really like the outdoor patio with fire pits and think next time we will sit out there and just enjoy wine and small plates as the dinner prices are a bit high.\n",

Frittata was watery, toast cold, served with no butter or preserves, fruit must have been leftover from the night before, brats dry as a bone. Potatoes overdone. Only redeeming quality was the iced coffee, but even that was served with heavy whipping cream that separated. Service excellent and they did comp one of our meals. Not sure if there's a different chef for brunch but they need to go back to culinary school:(\n",

With a comfortable and relaxed vibe (and lovely live music). The staff go out of their way to make you feel at home. The wine selection is unique and personal (by-the-glass options frequently change) with a wide spread on price points. The food is beyond high-caliber with excellent plating and great seasonal rotations of a variety of proteins and greens. The menu is diverse enough to please any mood. Mike Wahlberg, the master chef behind the fun din, is a culinary gem. Kudos.\n",

      "I'm not a food snob and I'm not very picky. I do expect for the price to reflect the quality of food and service. Unfortunately it didn't. The servers were not rude, but the were complacent and disengaged. The best food we had was our french fries.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the daily special which was a soft crab sandwich and my wife ordered the Ahi Tuna. After one bite of the Tuna we had to send it back. Again, we aren't very picky people but the Tuna was 25 dollars and it tasted so fishy, it was so strong that the noodles it was rested upon smelled and tasted fishy. Meanwhile I struggled my way through the soft crab sandwich, but I now wish I didn't as it is not sitting well. My wife ordered a burger to replace the Ahi, but it came out bland and with ingredients that weren't fresh. $14 is a lot for a burger and there are places in the valley that I think it is worth it - Deluxe burgers and Lush burgers being good examples...this burger was not worth it.\n",

      "I came here for a girls night last Thursday with a few friends. We had some wine and food out on the back patio. Unfortunately we arrived too late for Happy Hour.  The $5 a glass is a great deal even though the choices are limited. The even better deal is the free bruschetta board if you order a bottle; we definitely would have taken advantage of that if we had been there an hour earlier.  We were lucky enough to get to listen to the wonderful music of Sarah Vanell who was performing there that evening.  I thought I recognized her voice from Vincitorio's and so I googled it when I got home and sure enough it's the same girl.  She sort of sounds like Jewel but she sings a wide range of songs and puts her own stamp on the covers.  Just an awesome performer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bruschetta choices on the menu are pretty much the exact same descriptions as the offerings at Postino but after sampling them I can say that they are not quite the same caliber. The warm brie was good but not as impressive as I thought it would be.  I agree with April Q. that they are pretty skimpy with the bread which is surprising since it is just plain pita and didn't even taste like it was baked there. We also got a veggie flatbread which was a favorite of the girls who had been there before.  That was pretty tasty and I highly recommend it.  The dinner menu was short but there were a few entrees on there that I would like to try in the future.\n",

      "The other girls shared a couple of bottles of Pinot Grigio that were very reasonable priced.  I, the lone red drinker, had a couple glasses of a really nice GSM blend that I can't remember the name of (their wine list on the website must not be up to date since I don't see it there either).  Our server was absent for a while in the beginning but made it up by being very friendly and attentive the rest of the time we were there.  The main attraction of this place is their patio.  It was really nice sitting out there by the fire pit.  There are trees and lights, and you can choose to either sit at a table and chairs or comfy couches.  I love the fact that you can see the City Hall building, too; it looks so cool at night.  The only thing that took away from the pleasant, relaxing atmosphere was the fact that there were a lot of smokers out there.  I had to take away a star for that.\n",

      "- Warm Brie: ok portion of cheese, though hummus was meager and I think the \"grilled vegetables\" could've been more grilled and grilled-looking (as in grill marks, they looked bare and tasted bare).\n",
      "- House Soup: meh, not a fan.  It was pretty plain and served with very little croutons... not memorable nor something I'd order again\n",
      "- Fall Salad: I was really surprised at how sweet this salad was.  It was spring mix with 3 or 4 little pieces of butternut squash (needs more!) and the maple vinaigrette was completely sweet (duh, it's maple based).. as in they poured maple syrup on the salad and mixed it like that in a bowl.  It was not pleasant because it was just so over the top sweet.  I would not order this again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our companions loved their vintage burger, but agreed the soup was plain and not worth ordering.\n",

      "Another issue: sitting in the front patio means you sit on these small 'patio' tables that don't allow you to seat comfortably and eat... just an FYI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, when we ordered the Charcuterie Board, they served us 3 slices of bread, so I asked for \"1 more slice\" since there was 4 of us.. she brought 4 more out and charged us for it.. I thought that was kinda crappy - there were 4 of us and we got 3 breads and when I ask for 1 more, I get 4 more and then get charged.  Not cool. \n",

That's all the MORE reason to pay extra attention to the people that ARE in your place.  In this case, it was just us.

There was a hint of cheese spread across the toasted bread which was so slight that it couldn't be detected.

If it's so special, then give it to me and let me taste it!\n",

The first time, the service was impressive - the bartender tended to us at our table an was not only really friendly and genuine, but knowledgeable and very helpful in wine and food pairing (we ordered the meat plate and it did not disappoint).  The 2nd time was an equally pleasing experience.  Our party of 7 got seated within a few minutes of arriving and our server gal was friendly, nice, and quick.  We went through several bottles of wine and the service was never slow or lacking (btw - they have an excellent Kim Crawford SB in the bottle section - recommend!).  A few of us had the vintage burgers and though I wasn't a big fan of the thick buns, i put them aside and found the meat and rest of the toppings very tasty and highly filling.  The ambiance was perfect - they had live music (a beautiful and talented gal on her guitar) and she chose perfect songs for the venue and the fireplace was going.  The owner stopped by to say hello and everything was all good.  We are fans and will return again!\n",

      "I think this is the best wine bar in the east valley.  They have a cool patio and inside a few comfy couches by a fireplace.  They give you a free cheese or meat board with a bottle of wine so i rarely need to order any food.  Prices are good and so is service.  Great place for a romantic evening or a few wine-o friends.  I have not had much food there but the free (with bottle order) cheese plates and charcuterie boards are more than enough for me to eat.  If you are not a wine person they also have some real nice beers on the menu including one of my favorites, Four Peaks 8th Street Ale.  Good to see them support their local breweries.\n",

      "Hmmm.....this is my second visit to Vintage 95 and I was not impressed, in fact, I was a bit shocked at the going's on.  Don't get me wrong, I love the atmosphere in this place, but there has to be more than that.  I'll start by saying that my friends and I were watching a soft-core porn film right behind us.  Boots being unzipped, straddling and lots of tongue were all part of this low budget film.  It was disturbing to be so close to this display by two drunk people (and being unattractive didn't help either).  We brought this up to our waitress who said...\"you should see what goes on on the patio\".  If it's that shocking to the staff, how do you think the patrons feel?  It's not appropriate and it should be put to an end.  The Bacardi tastes like rock gut...I've been drinking Bacardi for a long time and sent back a few drinks on this evening asking the waitress if she was sure he was pouring Bacardi.  She confirmed he was and said that was probably as good as it was going to get - I don't know what's in that Bacardi bottle, but it isn't Bacardi, that's all I know.  My friend had an issue with her Tanqueray & Tonic too, so mixed drinks aren't the way to go here.  Another friend was disappointed in the selection of Zinfandel's.  The food was definitely better the first time we were there, which was right after they opened.  We ordered the Bruschetta and the bread was a bit soggy and there was way too much cheese on each of the 4 different varieties we tried.  I would probably go back, but I wouldn't have mixed drinks and hopefully they can take it down to an \"R\" rating.  The bright spot was the incredibly gorgeous guy that was at the table next to ours with his, uh, wife....who knows what she was because he kept taking his wedding ring on and off.  Oh, lots of fun people watching.\n",

We luckily found seats at the bar and ordered the bruschetta and a few glasses of  wine until our table was ready. The bruschetta in my opinion is not as good as Postinos, but was still very tasty.  I was not that hungry after the bruschetta so I just had the tomato bisque and the ricotta salad. Both were delicious. My boyfriend had the Tenderloin and was also great. The patio is great and had a fun vibe. Service was wonderful. I will defiantly be back and have been telling my friends.\n",

Our waitress was very attentive, we ordered the warm brie and hummus... along with a bottle of Malbec, then we decided to order an entrée to share...  We ordered the salmon and they brought it out on 2 plates, the presentation was nice, the salmon was encircled with grits and a green sauce and there were some julienned grilled veggies on top of the salmon but for $22, we basically got a \"taste\" , the entire 2 pieces of salmon couldn't have weighed more than 3 oz and the little bit of grits and veggies could not be considered \"sides\".  The salmon was tasty, I just wish there had been more of it.  I guess we paid for the nice atmosphere.  I would go back but probably just for wine and apps.\n",

When we arrived half our party was late but they were kind enough to seat us anyway (that's why this is a two star review). We decided to order some starters while we waited. We were seated minutes after happy hour ended. Other tables had delicious looking fries and the waiter agreed to let us order them despite happy hour having expired. How bad can a fry be before you stop eating it? Very bad. They were limp, greasy and chewy. The warm Brie was a room temperature gelatinous mess. The food was so bad we left, met the rest of our party outside, and ate elsewhere. There is a lot of competition on Boston Street and this place can't keep up.\n",

Yes, we dunked the flatbread in the soup - and it was ideal.\n",

For the main entrees we had the ahi, duck breast and the flatiron steak. Everything tastes so good, and cooking duck breast is very hard. So it was a pleasant surprise to have it done properly not too greasy or too dry and it had a good spice and flavor from the blackberry sauce. Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable, and guided us through the menu and the wine list. As for breakfast they have great fluffy pancakes that you must try! Also the egg in the hole with a fontina cheese sauce is perfect for brunch. Skip Postinos and give this place a try, the food is way better and they actually have a good wine selection!\n",

      "\n",
      "The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal \"vodka martini extra dirty extra cold\" which she judged to have \"perfect dirtiness\", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. \n",
      "\n",
      "The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. \n",

      "Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us \"you have to try the Vintage burger\", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.\n",

My wife's hamburger and my flatiron steak were way overpriced, even with the Groupon deal. The steak was served over beans that did not compliment the flavor. Our friend's salmon was very good but the vegetable entrée was a little strange tasting. Don't bother with Groupon for this place. We may return but it won't be for the entrée, probably be for a glass of wine and an appetizer. We will skip the entertainment as well. I never was a big melodica fan.\n",

      "Meh... I went her a few days ago with my family for an early dinner. The food was so so. We waited nearly and hour and a half for our entrees after our appetizer. The kitchen didn't open until 5:00 and we got there just after 4pm. We had already been seated and ordered and app before our server told us the kitchen wasn't open until 5. We finally got our entrees around 5:45 and they were disappointing. We got the stink eye the entire time we were waiting because my mom ( who has blood sugar issues) asked the server for some bread while we were waiting. Her burger came out totally burnt to a crisp. It looked like a school cafeteria patty. Maybe intentionally after she asked for bread. The chef and a few other men were in the expediting area and were glaring at her while she ate. She wanted to complain but we had been there for so long already she just wanted to eat. My husband had the salmon,and my brother had the duck. They both thought the dishes were very tasty. I had a salad that was good but not worth the $26 in my opinion. \n",

I love the exposed brick and older building feel...makes me feel like I'm back home (Pennsylvania) when I'm inside the place. The food is INCREDIBLE!! Honestly, the brushetta is some of the best I've had. I compare all wine bar brushettas to Postino's which is one of my favorite, and I gotta say this is right up there. The one with the salami and ricotta is probably my favorite, it's to die for!! The pistachio/date or fig/with a maple flavor is also a fav. Honestly they are ALL good...the artichoke one is another fav...I could go on and on ;-) I had one of the dinner specials a few weeks ago, a monk fish over gnocci with an asparagus creme sauce...OH MY! It was SOOO good. I hope they special it again. A friend had their tomato bisque soup and their fries and I tried both and they were great. The fries are addictive. The wine list is huge and I haven't been disappointed yet. I've tried their chocolate dessert which was wonderful. Our service has always been on-point as well.

The environment is nice- could be a great date night place given the lights are dimmed and the setting seems kinda romantic. Their HH menu isn't too extensive when it comes to the wine. They had 3 white & 3 red options for HH which was $5 per glass or $20 per bottle. I ordered a Cabarnet, which was good. \n",

He was nice but kind of awkward; he tried to upsell a few times, which became frustrating given we told him we were only interested in the HH specials. We ordered the fries-which were delicious and the bruschetta, which was just okay. Honestly, the only wine place I've experienced is Postino and I would choose them over this place any day. I think Vintage is more suitable for those looking to spend a lot more money & to have that expensive style meal. Just from the menu, everything was highly priced and from watching other orders come out, seemed to not coincide with the portions given. I don't think I will be going back.\n",

      "First of all, credit where credit is due, the food was fantastic and they have a very good patio that was great for a nice Saturday night dinner.  Service, however, was somewhat shocking for a restaurant of this caliber.  My husband and I have been searching for restaurants in Chandler with good food and unpretentious service.  They scored big on the first count but failed miserably on the second.\n",
      "\n",
      "We dropped in at about 4:45 on a Saturday for dinner.  We asked to sit outside.  The host said that was fine, the patio was empty but we would need to leave by 7:00 when he had reservations.  That's a bit odd to hear that we have to get out by a certain time, but we never take more than 2 hours to eat so no big deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sit down outside and order drinks and an appetizer and eventually dinner.  Our waiter was ok, but not terribly attentive or friendly.  Again, not a big deal but somewhat off-putting.   I had the salmon (excellent!) and my husband has the burger which was also very good.  We finish by about 5:45 and ask to see a desert menu.   We are looking over the menu when the host shows up at our table and tells us we have to leave our table.  His 7:00 reservation for our table was there an hour early and he was kicking us out of our table.  \"Luckily,\" though, he had a table inside we could squat at so that we could order desert and close out our tab.    He said he was sorry but he had to make these other people happy.  If we had just ordered a single round of drinks and mulled over them for an hour we might have understood, but we ordered several drinks, an appetizer, two entrees and were contemplating desert when he tried to kick us out of our table for a reservation that was a full hour early.  Had he told us we only had until 5:45 to eat and get out from the get go, we might have understood, but he told us 7:00.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We told him to close out our tab and we would get the hell out of there like he clearly wanted.  He came back and said that we could stay out our table the reservation \"luckily\" wanted a different one.....no thanks!!!   He ended up buying us a round of drinks but, honestly, by that time we were pretty irritated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get it.  We didn't have reservations on a Saturday night.  We were walk-ins and didn't expect to be treated like we had reservations.  Had they told us that meant we would need to be done by 6:00, I would have understood completely.  I felt, however, that they thought it was awesome to be there when they were completely dead, but once \"better\" people showed up, we needed to pay up and get the hell out.   Fairly sure this was our first and last visit.  Really a shame, as the food was excellent.\n",

Their bruchetta is comparable to Postinos, if you've been there, and the other cheese, olive, meat, etc. appetizers are big and delicious. I'd recommend this place over any in Downtown Chandler. It's my favorite! Seating is good inside and outside (huge fire pit is fun for big groups to sit around). I heard the Sunday brunch specials are also really awesome. It's a little pricier, but worth the quality and amount of food you get with each plate.\n",

The only real set back for us was where we sat...right next to the hostess stand where we got to hear all about one of the girls flat chest and how she wished she had bigger...um...you know. Then the other hostess got to make out with her boyfriend when he showed up. That was special. So, if we could have moved away from that it would probably get 4 maybe even 5 stars for us.\n",

      "I don't want to leave a bad review. However, as business owners, we felt I needed to. The feedback is the only way to change a problem. The measure of a business is not how they handle good situations, but how they handle mistakes, and every business will make mistakes. I made reservations well ahead of time for 2 I'm the afternoon. I stated in the online reservation comment box that it was for our 45th anniversary. We asked for a window table (only one) and for Nya, a server we had before. My husband got a phone call confirming our appointment and our request. When we get there the table had been given to someone else! We mentioned this and was basically told \"these things happen\". Land he gave a flippant apology clearly not respectful of the importance of this momentus occasion. The table was given to a young hip couple and by what the waiter said, we knew they were just given the table and had not reserved it well in advance. In addition my husband asked why they didn't put a reserved sign on the table and he replied they don't have any! REALLY? Any piece of paper with \"reserved\" hand written on it should do. They could have made everything right just by caring. Last person who appeared to be the owner or manager just listened to this and never intervened. We were polite, not disruptive but we were clearly unhappy. If I owned the business, I would have said, \"we made mistake, I am so sorry. For your inconvenience we will give you a free drink, appetizer, dessert or a coupon, etc.\" or some other nice thing to do. I would have at least given a warm apology and happy anniversary wishes along with superb service to make it right. They were almost empty at the time. We did something we never do, we walked out before ordering and the arrogant owner/manager didn't seem to even care.! Like I said, we were polite, just unhappy that our reservation requests at an off time were not respected. We went (without reservations, of course) to another nice restaurant where immediately upon entering the door and saying it was our 45th anniversary, they treated us like royalty! We will never go back to Vintage 95 because oh their superior, snobby, uncaring attitude!\n",

We arrived (last night) and our area on the patio was fantastic. Our every need was catered to by Emily, Ari, and John during our dinner.

They all agree that the meat had turned. I let the waiter know...who didn't seem to care either way. He asked if I wanted something else and seemed bit impatient while I looked.  The manager came and visited us, letting me know that they make their food fresh every morning and told me the rancid taste is due to  \"a different flavor profile than I am use to\".  I am not sure what flavor profile he likes, but sour, spoiled, meat isn't for me....so yes it is very different from my preferred flavor profile. \n",

The husband had a manhattan and liked it very much. My step mom and I split the gnocchi and the bruschetta and I had the tomato bisque with croutons. The tomato bisque was very tasty, smokey, I would get it again. The bruschetta was ok... the prosciutto was a little on the thick side. The bacon jam was very tasty. The gnocchi, on the other hand, was not so good...very dry and lacking flavor. It was nice that they split it into two bowls for us. The husband had the burger and liked it very much, I thought it was good, but not a 16$ burger.

      "Love the deals offered on Yelp. Went to a yoga event at the Crowne Plaza and came over here and paid $15 for $30 worth of food. My friend had their bruschetta board with four different options, I got to try a few and I liked them. I had the Sea Bass which I was not a fan of unfortunately. I expect Sea Bass to be light and this was very heavy. I will admit I tend to compare all Sea Bass to one I got in Texas, but this was a very heavy dish and after sweating outside in The July heat it was to much. They had live music and I liked the decor. Additionally the service was good and I appreciate they didn't give us a second glance when we walked in yoga pants. I will come back again and try something else.\n",

Bummer oh well, I ordered some bruchetta first. It was okay. Nothing exceptional. My man's vintage burger looks bomb though. I love the mix of regular potatoes and sweet potatoes. So since I enjoyed that, I wanted to order the burger as well if I can't have any other entrees. alright the server said. Then after a few more minutes he apologized again and said that it's prepping time, it'll be out in 15 more minutes. I said sure I'll wait. \n",

      "\n",
      "Regardless of the bad dinner experience I had on Christmas Eve, Vintage 95 has a great outdoor dining area that is very relaxed. Due to this, I decided that I'd give Vintage another chance with a large party. I wanted to host a 20 person bridal event. I submitted a request via the website to have an event coordinator get in touch with me. 5 days later, I still hadn't received a phone call or email. I decided to send a follow up email to try to get someone to contact me. At 7 pm that evening, the event coordinator finally called. I explained to her that I don't have a budget, and that I wanted my guests to have a beautiful unforgettable lunch. She said that she would send me a proposal right away the next day. 4 days went by, and I still hadn't received a proposal or any other form of communication from the event planner. This was actually pretty surprising to me, since during our phone call she told me at least 5 times that she loves to bring these types of events together and make things memorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, I decided that I wasn't going to chase someone around to give them my money. I'd rather spend more money at a different restaurant to ensure that I'm going to be given the customer service I deserve as a patron. \n",
      "\n",
      "On August 8, I sent a message via Facebook to the restaurant, to explain my disappointment. I STILL haven't heard from a member of management or an owner. I know the message was read, because late the next evening the event planner left me a voicemail. She said that her boss called her to let her know I sent a message the day prior. Her exact words on my voicemail, \"I know the proposal was very late but at least I got it to you today\".......... Really?\n",

The hubby and I decided to share a couple of starters...the pork belly and veggie flatbread.  The menu said that the pork belly was smoked.  I have no idea how that is possible.  There was no smoky flavor whatsoever and the fat wasn't rendered as if it was smoked.  However, the jalapeno grit cake and maple glaze that came with it were great.  The veggie flatbread was also a letdown.  The sauce was extremely sour and just didn't go well with everything else.  So, while I have no problem paying for a good meal, I think our meal was overpriced for what we got.\n",

The bartender has recommended several red wines, all of which were wonderful.  I've only eaten here once.  We had the bruschetta.  You get to pick a combo of four and all of them had great complimentary flavors.  We also had the Seared Duck Breast with Chipotle Sweet Potato Gratin and a Cherry Mojo and it was excellent.  I'm an avid listener of local music and they have some wonderful musicians here.  I've heard Sarah Vanell  several times and another favorite was Vinyl Station.\n",

      "They have chosen their eclectic wine menu very selectively. And their food pairings are very appropriate and tasty. But my honest feeling is that their pricing points are 30%-40% higher than they should be. They do try make good with it with the quality of their staff (especially Richard at the bar). But if you go in as a couple (even during happy hour) and have a couple glasses of wine each, share an appetizer and each get an entree, you'll easily be over $100 with tip. Good stuff, but not that good.\n",

      "Our first visit a few weeks ago was awesome. Great waiter (friendly & clearly communicated) and 1/2 price wine bottles on Sunday = awesome. Tonight, well... if it weren't for the company... A friend and I met for happy hour, arriving at 4. I guess I could have looked at menu more closely after a long day and challenged our waiter's suggestion, but I trusted our waiter to steer me to a good wine at a good price. It was HH! This was not a good decision - based totally on previous visit. He mentioned 2 Sauvignon Blancs - one from France that he didn't recommend. I took his recommendation. I learned neither was the HH wine (found out later the HH SB was from Chile). He didn't mention this. So when the bill came...shock. At almost $100 before tip, that's when we learned we didn't get happy hour deals. Our check showed $10 and $15 per glass - which we felt was expensive for Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc plus 1 appetizer - a combo meat and cheese board that was not all that - during HH. We joked that we should have met at Flemings. We'd eat & drink better for the same price. But we wanted to support a Downtown Chandler business. When my friend returned for her keys (after dessert elsewhere), that's when we asked the hostess to check happy hour menu. Guess we were had. Never again. I'm wiser now. If you go for happy hour, make sure your waiter doesn't lure you to spend more. Smart business to up sell? Not if you want return customers.\n",

      "I really wanted  to like this place.  I am hoping we just had back luck given many positive Yelp reviews; however our experience was less than adequate.  There are many choices for restaraunts in the valley and I would suggest this one be avoided. It takes little to make us happy so keep this in mind.  Our server (no intro) initially was not warm and in fact seemed cold so I tried to warm him up a bit and asked if he smiled? He responded he was fine, \"Just not Mickey Mouse.\"  1/2 a strike maybe as I get not everyone outwardly is happy. In the end he warmed up and tried to make things right.  I ordered Sangria to which I hoped would be amazing but not so much.  I have drank a lot of Sangria in my life and this by far was the worst I have had.   Sangria went back to the bar as kool-aid better. When we did finally get our order, most of the guys who ordered burgers did not get fries despite note of inclusion on the menu.  My husband and I ordered pork sliders and the turkey, jalapeño and avocado sliders.  The BBQ pork sliders were frozen in the middle and the avocado slices in turkey were not ripe.  Really, overall a bit of a miserable food experience on a beautiful Easter Sunday.  Our meal was comped but we ended up eating a side of fries and calling it good.  Our son had pancakes and he ate all 3 and loved them but they looked exactly the same as anything you would make at home. He was happy though. Not a single piece of garnish came on the orders and in fact none of our party of 13+ had any plate presentation going for them at all.  Last straw was the executive chef (picture attached) who must be for oversight only. He spent a good amount of time checking his phone, argued about visibly frozen food when we flagged him down to take ot back and noticeably forgot an apology.  Sorry Vintage 95, we will not be back or recommending you. Bummed\n",

      "\n",
      "We had reservations for an early dinner and were seated immediately at the back of the restaurant at a table for two by the wine room in a fairly empty room.  First impression - loved the decor!  It was obvious some care went into the choice of furnishings and end result looks great. The mixture of leather couches and high and low top solid wood tables were gorgeous.  But once we were at the table for a minute and others were seated at surrounding tables it became apparent that they had tried to squeeze too many tables in too small a space.  The servers couldn't maneuver around the guests' chairs and were constantly bumping into each other and the other seated patrons.  Even with the tight quarters they managed to keep our drinks and waters full and stop by at all the right times, kudos to them. \n",

      "The food portion of the evening started out ok, we got the pork belly and gaspacho soup as appetizers, both of which were decent although the gaspacho was not exactly what I expected (more like blended cold tomato soup with no chunks of veggies in it unlike typical gaspachos, it was still refreshing though).  We both ordered short rib for our main entree.  They took a while to come out which would have been find if it had been edible when it arrived.  When I got mine the meat was so hard I was a bit hesitant (and as it turns out rightly so) to try it.  I pulled apart the first piece with some effort and it was pretty gray inside and looked kind of dry.  I made the mistake of tasting it and wow was it worse than it looked.  It was extremely dry and stringy and tasted off.  Like they had made it the previous week, left it in the fridge uncovered and then heated it up in a super hot oven so whatever was left of the moisture evaporated and left a gray flavorless mess.  It was so bad I had to spit it out, and were you to ask my dining companion he would get a far off look in his eye and tell you with a bit of remorse that I am not a spitter. To add insult to injury the mashed potatoes under the short ribs were cold. The ex's short ribs were better but still not what I would expect from a place this pricey with 4 stars on Yelp.  I ended up sending mine back and they sent out another plate which was better but still not great and certainly not worth either the wait or the portion of the $44 that would have been allotted to cover the main dish.  My companion was done with his by the time my replacement meal came out, so I had a few bites and decided to wait for dessert to see if the meal could be salvaged.  We had the S'mores Chocolate Tarte (probably the best thing of the evening, very rich and very well executed) and the Coconut Tres Leches cake which the ex liked but I thought was meh (not a fan of Tres Leches anyway).  Then the bill showed up.  The server took care to explain that there was an extra charge for the third Short Rib on the check and pointed out that the charge had been removed at the bottom of the check.  I thought he was trying to explain that they had comped all or part of my meal (which I would have expected given how terrible the first short ribs were), but when we looked at the check it was exactly as he had described.  They charged full price for what was essentially half a meal with a ruined main course and \"comped\" the extra $44 that was for the replacement short ribs.  That sealed the deal for both of us, neither of us will be back. I may have been tempted to give it another shot since I like the concept, the location (close to home) and the service but instead the management lost possible repeat customers and earned a 1 star Yelp review by charging full price for a poorly executed, sub par meal.\n",

      "We went to this amazing Wine Bistro on Jane's  Birthday....and had an memorable experience. The wine selection and wine room is impressive, and at some reasonable prices.  The menu has something for everyone.  I had the remark-able hamburger, and it was one of the best I've had...but, they also have delicious soups and appetizers.  The bruscetta is five star! We've spoken with the owner Gavin, who used to be the chef at House of Tricks in Tempe, and you can see the pride he has in his place.  Friday and Saturday nights are always packed, but they take reservations.  Check out the back patio....big space, but very intimate settings with fire pit, outside bar, and lots of heaters.  The inside is charming.  Comfortable chairs...and lots of seating around the fireplace.  The Bar has a lot of character with the backdrop being the 100 year old brick wall from the old Chandler Post Office.  Once you go, you'll continue to go back...it's that good.  Congratulations, you've got a winner!\n",

      "We didn't do anything from the \"starter\" section.  Our starter was a bruschetta order.  Theirs is not those little 2\" bread circles.  They appear to have taken a full Italian loaf and sliced it thick (about an inch).  Four pieces (there are six to choose from), all very unusual and unique.  This really is a meal all by itself.  Now I'm not really a cheese guy.  I like mozzarella, ricotta, paremsan, and such (i.e. Italian cheeses usually on Italian food).  These things have goat cheese, feta, cream cheese, etc.  I didn't really expect to like these, but this was a treat for my lady and she LOVES different cheeses.  Well, I tried them...and they were good!  I think I liked the salmon and pesto one best (I forget which cheese was on it).\n",

      "\n",
      "Finally, my wife had the BLT salad and I had the pulled pork.  I almost went with the grinder, but wanted a hot sandwich (and the grinder is cold).  Both were excellent.  I was a bit hesitant because my pulled pork standard is Joe's Real BBQ, and that's simply one of the best ever.  But this was a very respectable (and delicious) sandwich.  Most places I would not order the pulled pork because it is such a disappointment compared to Joe's, but this one I would order again.  It holds up well against Joe's.  (Joe's is a bit better but it's not a rout.)  My wife really (really!) liked her BLT salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were so enjoying everything that, despite being quite full, we ordered one of their desserts.  The lady chose the coconut tres leches.  I'm not a fan of coconut, so you can't really go by me.  But she loved it.  It was a large piece, and she really enjoyed the flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "We really enjoyed the entire dining experience.  The seating, the ambiance, the attentive servers, and of course the food.  My wife was saying \"best lunch ever!\", and even posted such commentary on Facebook.  She was actually excited by the meal.  When was the last time that happened to you?  I'm pretty sure if you're reading this that it didn't happen at the Olive Garden or Chili's!  But I'll bet it will happen here.\n",

One more thing I was simply so bummed about was they discontinued the rock shrimp and that was my FAVORITE.

With a chef and wine driven concept, I usually hand my menu to the server/bartender, and let them order for me, and which I did in this case, and he guided us perfectly. We started with the bruschetta sampler, Brie app, and Italian flatbread, wow!! I asked the bartender to recommend a red wine with everything, and the cab he chose was perfect. As we enjoyed our culinary picassos, I gazed around and enjoyed the rustic feel of the brick walls and exposed ceiling, and the big leather sofas next to the fireplace was a really nice touch. Definitely a place to bring someone special in your life that you just want to chill with and relax with. We then moved on to the tomato bisque, which was perfectly silky and not heavy at all. After that, the cheeseburger (a must have). If I could sit there for 24 hours and enjoy every menu item, I would, my taste buds were very happy. \n",

We also decided to get some snacks, so went with the Piri Piri Fries and the Arancini.  The Piri Piri fries had a spicy taste to it, which we both liked.  The Arancini was really good especially with the sauce around it.  Really enjoyed the happy hour.  Would like to come here again in the future.\n",

This place could benefit from removing either the couches or a few of the tables, so people dont bump into your table or chair as they try to use the restroom or exit the building.  Our waiter didn't seem to know much about wine varietals. He basically stood there waiting for us to decide without any recommendations from his own wine list. Here's a thought.....if someone is unfamiliar with your particular wine list, ask them questions about what type of wines they enjoy? What kind of palette experience they are looking for. Simple enough for anyone to be able to recommend a wine or two from their own list, assumimg they have done their homework. Not all Cabs are alike, buddy!

      "Had family that was going to a show at the Chandler Arts Center, so we wanted something close by that was nice. Chose this place off of Google Map and so glad we did.  The hostess was friendly and had our table ready and waiting with ice water already set up.  Our server Axel was very friendly and helpful with choosing drinks and food.  We started with the happy hour brie for $5 which is very small but very good, I would say only shareable if you are getting something else. We also tried the bruschetta board which almost every restaurant has these days.  The toppings we chose were delicious and the bread was good but a little too thick for my liking. For dinner I had the Ahi Tuna topped with a homemade kimchi over what I can only describe as rice patty heaven!!!  I also tried one of the salads which had pistachios, banana chips and dried papaya I think, either way it was also really delicious.  Its a great place to sit and have some bites and wine or for dinner.  They have a small patio with a long table that looks like fun with a larger party and cooler weather.\n",

You would probably have to wait five minutes for it to get on the floor and as for my burger it was over cooked and dry.. It was a pork and beef patty, sounds awesome! Right? Well not here but made well I am sure could be magnificent.. This place it more of a tapas and wine not dinner..

      "My mom and I had a pleasant lunch date here yesterday! They offer a lunch special that includes a choose two option of a half sandwich, cup of soup, or salad. I had the Reuben and the tomato bisque. Both were delicious. My mom enjoyed the turkey panini. She ordered a patron margarita and I had the ginger's a peach. Excellent drinks, especially mine! It was different and very refreshing to sip while out on their patio. HOWEVER, I have two complaints. First, the amount of flies is disturbing and very disgusting. It was not just one or two flies... It was honestly really gross. Perhaps because the patio is right next to the trash cans behind the restaurants? Meh. Another complaint: my mom's margarita was $15. She got two, which means we paid $30 for two margaritas. Lol. I feel like that price tag was a little ridiculous. If the fly swarms diminish and the margarita price becomes reasonable, I could boost this place to 4 stars easily. I will be back, but maybe not to the patio or to enjoy a margarita.\n",

The interior has a nice wine cafe feel while the outdoor patio has an upscale hotel patio look complete with high end outdoor furniture and fire pits.  It's a great place to hang out and have dinner or a glass of wine this time of year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: The pulled pork and bruschetta that we had were amazing! The food was fresh, portions were nice and it all tasted amazing.  Whoever is running their kitchen definitely knows what they're doing.  Aside from the food, the building and decor were the second big selling point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: This restaurant really missed the mark with their staff.  The hostess was nice but struggled with where to put the six of us despite the fact that there weren't many people in that night (alone, not that big of a deal).  Our waiter was nice but couldn't tell us much about the menu items or specialties (they only have a one page menu at launch).  We were pleased to find wine from one of our favorite wineries, Arizona Stronghold, but really disappointed that the waiter couldn't tell our friends anything about the wine and completely butchered the location calling it Cochise Valley.  Sorry dude, it's Cochise County and that is a major flub against this AZ native.  Finally, it was great to see the owner come out and show off his new digs to his friends, but a word to the wise, we are the customers, you should make an effort to come over and welcome us and thank us for coming in.  It's repeat business from customers like us that will dictate your success in the future.  The reality is that the owner and staff form the personality of the establishment and ultimately that's what keeps people coming back (check the wait at an Anthony Canecchia or Joe Johnston restaurant to test that theory).\n",

The waitress was just attentive enough not to be annoying but also was available when we needed. Didn't try the food but there was a pretty good selection of wines. The decor inside is wonderful and cozy, and the patio is a great place to have a group as well. It's in a nice area of town if you want to walk around and see the quaint shops.\n",

My aunt pointed to an empty couch. Hostess replied \"obviously thats taken because there are girls sitting across from it.\"  Puzzled, I said \"ok, why don't you just seat us then.\" \n",
      "Her reply, \" yes I'm the hostess that's my job\" with sincere bitchery.  I just stood there and stared in complete shock. I could have just slapped her in the face. But I held my composure and she sat us. Never ever have we been insulted by anyone let alone a hostess. What terrible service. This establishment needs to take a closer look at this young lady (if that's even what you can call her).  She is the first face everyone sees.  We should have just left but really wanted to try out the wine.  Well OBVIOUSLY the most she will ever be is a hostess if she continues to be such a rude brat. Millennials are the worst!   Won't be going back here. Wine was overpriced as well.\n",

      "We were quite disappointed in our experience last night at Vintage 95. When we arrived for our reservation, they led us to an outdoor table directly under misters. It was 7:30 in the evening, the sun was setting, and we were being soaked by the water coming off the mister. We asked to be reseated, and they offered to turn the misters off. We almost left at that point, and after our evening we wish we had. \n",

My medium rare burger was partially medium on one side and medium well on the other. The bacon had seen better days for sure. My husband had cold potatoes to go with his steak, as did our friend. The steaks ended up being cut up for the dogs at home, they were so poorly prepared. The service did not continue as it had started, it became lax and we almost had to flag him down a few times to receive our bill. \n",

Hubby had the tenderloin and I had the Rib-eye.  Both were done to perfection and the sides were wonderful as well.  Portion sizes were generous without being massive. We both had a glass of wine and the wine list is pretty good if a bit pricey.  The ambiance and decor are outstanding.  The only reason I did not give it five stars was the fact that the waiter who has served me at least 10 times for lunch didn't even begin to recognize me and asked if we had ever been there before, he was also a little on the slow side for refills. There was no bread either which we thought odd.\n",

      "The food at Vintage 95 and the array of wine choices offered are spectacular.  However;  be aware that the prices for the glasses and bottles of wine are seriously thievery if you've ever traveled to Europe.  I lived in Europe for two years and love the French, German and northern Italian wines and Champagnes.  Vintage charges $36 a glass or $140-180 dollars a bottle for Italian Amarone Valpolciella.  That is a top red wine of the Veneto region of Italy.  There you can buy a bottle of it for $22-25 Euro a bottle and here the same is $58-$70 a bottle for Amarone. To charge $36 a glass is just ridiculous.  I think they count on the fact that Americans are enthralled with all things Italy and charge these prices.  In Italy you can drink a nice Pinot Grigio for .60 Euro cents a glass or a nice red for 2-4 Euros a glass.  Be cautious of what you're paying for, and go to Total Wine and buy a nice bottle of Tommasi Amarone for $58 or a Classico or Ripasso for $12-$30 a bottle.\n",

The pork belly was crispy and soft and complimented the corn cake just perfectly. \n",

      "Second: Braised Beef Shortrib on Charred Tomatillo Mash Potatoes with a Mole Sauce, Tortilla Hay and Sesame Seeds. The shortrib was a little on the dry side, but the sauce is what made the flavor. The tomatillo mashed potatoes were outstanding. Just something different - and again, perfectly paired with the mole shortrib sauce and perfect crunch with the tortilla hay. \n",

      "Third: I'm not much of a dessert person, but definitely wish I would have ordered the S'more - it looked like graham cracker crust, with a brownie on top with marshmallow fluff.. vs. my sorbets, which I loved each - the pineapple is creamy - the other two not as much, but each had great strong flavors. \n",

I came with a date and we started with looking at their drink menu. Vintage 95 has a awesomely constructed wine room with a chandelier to show it off! My dated ordered a cocktail drink while I just shot for the Tempranillo. For out food we started with the Artisan board with aged Gouda, Prosciutto, pickles, salted almonds, bread, grapes, and crostinis with a strawberry jam. Overall, a solid start to my wine; the aged Gouda was solid cheese, but perfect texture to mix with our pickles and cured meat. The strawberry jam was totally fresh and meshed well with our bread and crostini. For our entrees, my date ordered the Flatiron Steak while I went for the Pork Chops. Both protein was cooked to perfection, which we both ordered medium. The brussel sprouts was excellent according to my date whom doesn't really eat brussel sprouts. My pork chops has a perfect sweet bite because of the roasted cherry tomato and lemon mustard cream while the texture was slightly chewy. It came along with an over-easy egg too!\n",

      "We ordered a \"cheese\" board and portions were skimpy and it was overpriced. So then we tried a flat bread that we imagined would come out warm and it was room temp close to being chilled. The menu should indicate this is not a warm/hot appetizer.  When we asked the waiter if the flat bread should be warm he took it away to 'ask' someone.  The manager came over to our table to explain and agree the temp of this app should be stated on the menu.  No kidding!!!  Maybe something should have been offered in a response to the confusion.\n",

Vintage 95 has all of these!  Not to mention how refreshing it was to deal with a hostess, Jocelyn,  that wasn't 16 years old and actually knew what she was doing!  When we were seated our waitress, Emily was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive,  and never rushed us.  The wine list is extensive, however, I think they should add more low range wines in the $25-$35 range to their list.   The warm and cozy decor of the place makes you want to stay and eat and drink for hours.  The outdoor patio in the back has a great fire pit and romantic lighting.  I HIGHLY suggest making a reservation or you could be waiting a long time for a table.  There was a problem with one of our entrees and the manager took care of it immediately.  I look forward to my next visit to Vintage 95.\n",

      "I am not sure if we just really had a bad experience or if other reviewers are totally crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "After reading all the great reviews about Vintage 95 we (myself, the hubby and two other couples) decided to venture here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things we did like:\n",
      " The patio is super cute and quaint.  We had some great weather and our server Eric was fantastic.  Plus they had one of my favorite wines-Dr. Loosen Reisling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now on to the bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "We tried the bruschetta which according to many reviews was top notch.  We only tried the goat cheese and bacon jam (out of curosity) and the mozzarella with grape tomatoes.  Eric really talked up the bacon jam making it seem like it would be the most amazing thing I've ever tasted.  It was the complete opposite.  It was very underwhelming and loaded with salt.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the ahi tuna dish which was pretty good but again-loaded with salt.  I felt so dehydrated the next day from all the salt I had!\n",
      "\n",
      "My hubby ordered a burger which came over cooked.  He returned it to the kitchen and they corrected it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is the really bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 of our friends ordered the stuffed poblano.  It sounded like it would be delish.  One of my friends said that hers was cold inside.  Like flat out cold.  Gross.  Then her hubby and our other friend that ordered it said the same thing.  We informed Eric who returned them to the kitchen.  The manager came out to offer his apology and informed them that it would be 5-6 minutes for them to return.  15 minutes later they did.  The EXACT same dishes, not reheated but simply piled with new sauce AND when they brought them back to the table they had no idea who's plate was who's.  The gal that brought them back just set them down like they were brand new dishes-totally ignoring the fact that one of them had been cut into pieces!  SO TACKY.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say everyone was totally disgusted at that point.  We once again told Eric and he was more then apologetic.  I felt really bad for him actually.  And once again we received a visit from the manager.  He whisked the dishes away and promptly took an order for some salads for them.  Which they actually liked.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I really tried to give this place 2 stars. I mean in the end the service we received was exceptional.  The manager was more then gracious about the situation and rectified the problem, I just can't do it though. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will not be back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok so after I posted my original review I received the absolute most sincere email from the manager Gavin.  Because of this email I changed my review to two stars and all of us that attended the other night said we would be willing to give it another shot (maybe not order food) because of his email. Plus they did have a great atmosphere on the patio and a great wine list :) I have had bad experiences before and have voiced my opinion but I have never had a manager take the time to review my posted comments and contact me.  So you know never know...maybe we will be back and fingers-crossed our experience will be much better.\n",

      "A group of us had dinner on the back patio on a quiet Wednesday night.  It certainly is large and pretty with the two big fire pits but you can't be satisfied with ambiance alone, especially when you're hungry.  To start with our table shared the baked brie and a variety of the bruschettas   The brie was nice (I liked the presentation of grilled squash with it) and the bruschettas were also pretty tasty except for the pistachio date one.  That was horribly sweet and kind of gross.  After the appetizers the meal kind of went downhill.  The tomato bisque was too smoky in flavor and was left untouched by most of us.  The kale salad I ordered was tough and inedible and the flatbread I got as a replacement was tasteless and bland. I did like my rose and our server was very patient and pleasant.  But with such subpar food, good wine in a nice setting wasn't enough. The table next to us had the right idea, they ate elsewhere and came here for a nightcap.\n",

      "I am always in search of the perfect Manhattan so we started off with the Mainstay Manhattan  It was a great blend and I enjoyed the fact that it was served up.  We started off with the artisan board, which was a little smaller then I was expecting, however I enjoyed how they let you pick your meat and cheese from a wide selection.  Next, we shared a BLT with light raspberry vinaigrette.  We also shared the short rib braised in a mole sauce which was fantastic, the sauce had great flavors and the meat was very tender.  Our server split both of the entrees without us asking which was appreciated.  As the name states, they have an extensive wine list we tried a bottle that came recommended and it did not disappoint - Random Ridge.  \n",

      "This was a great experience for my wife and I last night! We had a groupon discount for a 3 course meal and it proved to be an excellent purchase.  Our waiter Axel was superb! He literally came to our table more than seven times to make sure we were being serviced  and or satisfied.  I'll definitely ask for him on our next visit. Our first course was the Gem Salad.  It was excellent! However, it could be listed as a desert salad, with its sugary ingredients (I'm a diabetic). No complaints though (we cleaned our plate). Our second course (we shared) was the smoke pork belly. It was excellent! We definitely recommend this as your second course! We ended up competing for the last bite! My wife had the salmon and rice for her entrée and I had the short rib/chuck burger with mixed fries. Both was excellent.  Both were paired with wine (we're not drinkers) and it was tasty.  Warning, you need an appetite to down their 3 course meal! I could have given this restaurant a 5 star review, but, there was a longer than expected delay between the \"courses\". When I mentioned this to wife, she reminded me that we were not at a \"Denny's\". We recommend that you try Vintage 95 for a great experience.  Ask for Axel as your waiter.  I think the waiter plays an important part in your experience!\n",

      "After writing my last review and then ultimately returning to Vintage 95, I was beyond impressed by the level of customer service we received.  I can't be sure if they saw my last review or not but who cares, what mattered was that they remembered who we were and they came over and personally apologized for what happened to our bikes outside of their establishment and bought our first round of drinks.  It really meant a lot that they remembered who we were and took the time to acknowledge that shitty situation.  We left smiling and impressed and will definitely continue to frequent Vintage 95.  It really is one of the best patio's around, some of the best live music and a great staff.\n",

We ordered a bottle of wine, the brie pear & onion jam bruschetta appetizer and a grilled chicken panini sandwich.

      "Tried Vintage 95 for the first time.  Friendly staff and fun atmosphere.  A pretty solid wine list, especially wines by the glass.  The menu is about right...variety but not overwhelming.  Our table tried the short rib, grouper, and pork chop.  The portions were adequate and the presentation was inviting.  We all enjoyed our own dish, but shared bites and agreed that all the food was delicious.  Service was prompt and attentive.  A young lady was playing guitar and singing near our table but we were still able to converse without difficulty.\n",

      "Warm, classy, and divine. Three words that describe the food, wine, and music. I had the watermelon salad with salmon, and the mix of flavors was indescribable. My husband had the beef tenderloin (recommended by the waitress), and he was making all sorts of sounds and comments about how amazing it was. The waitress gave excellent recommendations, and we weren't disappointed in the slightest. The live music was phenomenal...the artist had the most intriguing and distinctive voice. I was sad when she packed up to leave before we were done. This place is a must-try for downtown Chandler. The only drawback is the price tag, but I believe it's worth it!\n",
